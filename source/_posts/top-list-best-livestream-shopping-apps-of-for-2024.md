### Free Streaming Services

First off, here are the **free streaming services** available today. You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don‚Äôt worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.

#### Tubi

Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it‚Äôs a fair trade-off.

![tubi interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-02.jpg)

#### Peacock

Peacock offers a two-tiered approach. The free tier gives you everything, including movies, shows, popular NBCUniversal titles, news, and sports ‚Äì but with ads. But the real treasure lies in the Premium subscription ($6 or $12/month). Here, you‚Äôll unlock a vast content library, such as live TV channels. So, consider upgrading for a more comprehensive selection and an ad-free experience.

#### Crackle

If you‚Äôre a fan of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Crackle is your free portal to their content. However, you can also find other shows that you‚Äôll surely love. While the library is smaller than Tubi and Peacock, it‚Äôs an excellent option for Sony enthusiasts. Remember, you‚Äôll encounter ads along the way.
