It seems like YouTube also pushes live content which means live creators have an edge compared to the ones that don’t go live.

### 5\. Promote your broadcast

![Promote your broadcast](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-6.jpg)

We live in an attention economy where hype is everything. If you look at some of the biggest live streamers, they create so much hype that people from all over the web would be curious enough to leave what they are doing and watch their streams. There are two main aspects to it.

First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.

But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.

However, you need to have a loyal audience in order to do so. People use YouTube to get information or some sort of entertainment. Whether you are a new creator or someone who already has a set audience, your main focus should be to discuss hot topics or play trending games to get views faster and efficiently.

Then, you need to go live, add the right description, choose tags, and talk about that particular topic to gain traction from people all over the world.

It seems like YouTube also pushes live content which means live creators have an edge compared to the ones that don’t go live.

We live in an attention economy where hype is everything. If you look at some of the biggest live streamers, they create so much hype that people from all over the web would be curious enough to leave what they are doing and watch their streams. There are two main aspects to it.

First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.

But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.

### 6\. Collaboration
