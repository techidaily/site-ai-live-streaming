Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.

* **GPU or graphic cards**

Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU's workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.

1. **Microphone**

Although you might get by using a gaming headset's built-in microphone for a bit, it's better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.

1. **Webcam**

If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.

You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.

### Understanding Twitch Streaming Rules

Aside from preparing your streaming gear, you must also understand Twitch streaming rules to avoid any potential violations that could result in penalties or even suspension of your account. Twitch's community guidelines cover a wide range of topics, including harassment, hate speech, copyright infringement, and mature content. You can read the full Twitch streaming rules [here](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en%5FUS).

## Part 2: Comprehensive Guide To Stream Live on PC, Mac, or Smartphone on Twitch

Once you've gathered all the necessary equipment, you can proceed with the following steps to start your Twitch stream.

### How to stream Twitch live on PC or Mac

**Step 1:** Download and install [Twitch Studio](https://www.twitch.tv/broadcast/studio) on your PC or Mac. Then, launch Twitch Studio and log in to your Twitch account. You'll receive a prompt to connect your microphone and webcam.

**Step 2:** Use Twitch Studio to customize your Twitch stream with different scenes and settings. Experiment with these features to find what works best for your livestream.

![Customize scenes for Twitch livestream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-3.jpg)

**Step 3:** When you're ready to start broadcasting, click "Start Stream" at the bottom of the Twitch Studio. Then, select your stream category and enter your live stream title. Hit "Go Live" to begin streaming.

![How to live stream on Twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-4.jpg)

### How to stream Twitch live on a smartphone

Starting Twitch streaming from your smartphone is a bit different, as the app primarily allows broadcasting from your device's camera. Here's how to live stream on Twitch from your smartphone:

**Step 1:** Download and install the [Twitch App](https://www.twitch.tv/downloads).

**Step 2:** Log in to the Twitch app. Then, go to your profile and tap "Go Live." If you are using newer version of the Twitch app, you can tap “Create.”

![Start Twitch Live on smartphone](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-5.jpg)

You'll then have two options: "Stream Games" or "Stream IRL." The "Stream IRL" will allow you to live stream on Twitch using your phone's camera, while the first option lets you stream mobile games.

![Twitch streaming on smartphone](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** Grant access to your camera and/or microphone before starting your stream.

**Step 4:** Set up the stream and Go Live. Give your stream a name, choose a content category, and select the camera you want to use.

Once you've completed these steps, press the "Start Stream" button, and you'll be live on Twitch.

### Key elements of success for streaming on Twitch

While the process for starting Twitch streaming may be similar for all streamers, what makes a streamer successful? Based on reports, there are a few key elements of success for streaming on Twitch.

1. **Engaging content**

Successful Twitch streamers captivate their audience with compelling content that resonates with viewers. This could include entertaining gameplay, informative discussions, or engaging activities. If people like your stream, they might subscribe or donate their money.

1. **Make use of the interactive features**

Twitch stream labs offer unique features like chat rooms and special emojis, fostering interaction between streamers and viewers. Streamers actively engaging with their audience tend to cultivate a loyal and enthusiastic community.

1. **Consistency and persistence**

This is often the toughest part. On Twitch, consistency is crucial. Successful streamers usually maintain regular schedules to make sure their audience knows when to expect new content. If you are new, continuous live streaming can be an effective strategy to engage with your audience consistently and increase your channel's visibility.

## Part 3: Best AI-Powered Tool for You To Set Up a 24/7 Live Stream on Twitch

If you want to make your Twitch channel stand out and automate the live streaming process, you can use Wondershare Virbo Live. With this tool, you can set up a 24/7 live stream on Twitch without needing to be present all the time.
