### 03 Is Amazon Live Streaming Right for You?

Amazon Live is an effective tool for starting a major sale or increasing the overall awareness of your product. The program streams live videos on the Amazon Live homepage to your brand’s product details pages giving you more exposure. You can speak about your products or simply demonstrate how they work. This makes Amazon Live a highly engaging promotional tool that sellers and influencers can use to drive more informed shoppers to buy their products, Here are some pros and cons of using Amazon Sale live streaming:

#### Pros

* A free live-streaming platform for sellers
* Offers creative tools and resources to effectively promote your products
* Amazon Live selling is a small part of the growing market and offers the opportunity for brands to scale

#### Cons

* Low consumer engagement rates with low-quality videos
* You will still need a creative team with resources to represent your brand well
* Amazon Live is still a fledging service and does not offer influencer marketing nor have its own place on Amazon’s website navigation yet

## Part 2: Step Guidance: Getting Started with Amazon Live

To create a livestream on Amazon, you need to be a U.S. Professional Seller either registered as a U.S. Vendor or in the Amazon Brand Registry. Sellers who meet the requirements can create their livestreams through the [Amazon Live Creator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) mobile app.

## Part 1\. Why is MLB Restricted in Different Regions for Users?

TV viewership of MLB games is declining due to geographical restrictions. Local TV channels purchase the broadcasting rights and impose a blackout policy. This policy restricts the game and makes it unavailable in other regions. In this way, blackouts protect the rights of local broadcasters and live-streaming services.

Moreover, the blackout policy varies according to different factors. They include league agreements, regional broadcasting rights, and teams' home territories. For instance, at least one team is blackout out in every region of the United States. Even some surrounding regions of specific teams also have blackout restrictions. Lowa is the worst blackout out in the USA state, with six teams blacked out.

Due to having limitations, fans are forced to find **MLB streaming sites** to watch matches. By doing so, they can utilize live stream channels to bypass region-locked restrictions.
