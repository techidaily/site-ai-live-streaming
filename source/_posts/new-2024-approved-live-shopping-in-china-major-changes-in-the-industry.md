## Part 1\. The Basic Concept of Livestream Shopping: What It Is?

Livestream shopping is a practice that involves product promotion through a live video. This innovative concept creates an engaging environment for shopping through live video entertainment. Unlike traditional e-commerce, livestream shopping encourages active audience participation. As a result, viewers can get real-time product demonstrations and responses from the hosts.

Now that you know the concept of **livestream shopping in China**, let's head to its requirements. You don't need any physical platform as it operates completely online. Navigate through this section to learn about the requirements for successful livestream shopping:

### 1\. Video Equipment

You need a fine camera to ensure clear video for high-quality product display. Also, there should be a tripod stand to keep this camera stable and cover multiple angles. You may also use ring lights or LED panels, as good lighting is crucial for better visibility.

### 2\. Audio Equipment

Make sure to use an external microphone, as a dedicated one ensures better audio quality. Also, a hands-free microphone makes operability easier for hosts moving around in the live stream.

This trend came to the attention of millions of Chinese consumers. Also, it appeared to be a convenient way, as everyone got smartphones and payment cards for easy procession.

## Part 1\. The 10 Best Streaming Video Services

With diverse platforms catering to every taste and budget, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. But worry not, fellow explorer! This part will unveil the best **web streaming services** offering unique strengths and features. Get ready to unlock a world of curated content and personalized recommendations, from Hollywood blockbusters to cult classics, binge-worthy shows, and live sports.

### Free Streaming Services

First off, here are the **free streaming services** available today. You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don’t worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.

#### Tubi

Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it’s a fair trade-off.

![tubi interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-02.jpg)

#### Peacock

Peacock offers a two-tiered approach. The free tier gives you everything, including movies, shows, popular NBCUniversal titles, news, and sports – but with ads. But the real treasure lies in the Premium subscription ($6 or $12/month). Here, you’ll unlock a vast content library, such as live TV channels. So, consider upgrading for a more comprehensive selection and an ad-free experience.

![peacock interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-03.jpg)

#### Crackle

If you’re a fan of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Crackle is your free portal to their content. However, you can also find other shows that you’ll surely love. While the library is smaller than Tubi and Peacock, it’s an excellent option for Sony enthusiasts. Remember, you’ll encounter ads along the way.

![crackle interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-04.jpg)

### Premium Streaming Services

## Part 1\. The 10 Best Streaming Video Services

With diverse platforms catering to every taste and budget, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. But worry not, fellow explorer! This part will unveil the best **web streaming services** offering unique strengths and features. Get ready to unlock a world of curated content and personalized recommendations, from Hollywood blockbusters to cult classics, binge-worthy shows, and live sports.

### Free Streaming Services

First off, here are the **free streaming services** available today. You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don’t worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.

#### Tubi

Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it’s a fair trade-off.

![tubi interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-02.jpg)

#### Peacock

Peacock offers a two-tiered approach. The free tier gives you everything, including movies, shows, popular NBCUniversal titles, news, and sports – but with ads. But the real treasure lies in the Premium subscription ($6 or $12/month). Here, you’ll unlock a vast content library, such as live TV channels. So, consider upgrading for a more comprehensive selection and an ad-free experience.

![peacock interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-03.jpg)

## Boost Sales with Live Shopping: Learn Winning Strategies From Top Brands

**Live shopping** has quickly grown in popularity due to the see-no-want-now mentality. Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the **online live shopping** success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping

A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.

### What is live stream shopping?

Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.

![live stream shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg)

One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:

### 1\. Stream not starting

![Stream not starting](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-8.jpg)

One of the most common problems with YouTube Live is streams not starting. Imagine you have an audience of people waiting but the stream just does not start. It can be unresponsive, which is a common issue with YouTube Live.

Here’s what you can do to fix the issue. Firstly, you need to verify your account and wait for 24 hours for this issue to be fixed. It is because new channels need this type of verification to allow you to start streaming.

However, if that still doesn’t fix the issue, you should try restarting your streaming service and computer. After a good reset, you can start streaming again and it should get you up and running.

### 2\. Poor video and audio quality

![Poor video and audio quality](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-9.jpg)

We all know many online streams have poor video and audio quality. It can be due to a bad internet connection, and if you are streaming from your cellular data, then it can be inconsistent at times, making your viewers angry with the poor video and audio quality.

Choose a lower-resolution setting in your streaming software. Close unnecessary background applications consuming bandwidth. You can also consider investing in a better internet connection. For audio quality, try to invest in a nice microphone as audio quality can make a day and night difference.

### 3\. Laggy stream

![Laggy stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-10.jpg)

Similar to poor video and audio, a laggy stream can occur due to a bad internet connection. Most streamers have a plethora of applications opened in the background that all take some level of internet.

Consider Steam for example. Applications like Steam will take a big chunk of your internet whenever they are running in the background. If you are suffering from a laggy stream, try to minimize the background applications and close them if unneeded.

A lot of people suffer from a lack of interaction even if they have slowly started to build a respectable viewer count. So, what should you do in that situation? Actively engage with viewers by responding to comments, asking questions, and running polls/contests.

Encourage viewers to interact with each other. Invite guests or co-hosts to add diverse perspectives. You should always be trying something new that would excite the viewers into taking part.

### 2\. Poor video and audio quality

![Poor video and audio quality](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-9.jpg)

We all know many online streams have poor video and audio quality. It can be due to a bad internet connection, and if you are streaming from your cellular data, then it can be inconsistent at times, making your viewers angry with the poor video and audio quality.

Choose a lower-resolution setting in your streaming software. Close unnecessary background applications consuming bandwidth. You can also consider investing in a better internet connection. For audio quality, try to invest in a nice microphone as audio quality can make a day and night difference.

Similar to poor video and audio, a laggy stream can occur due to a bad internet connection. Most streamers have a plethora of applications opened in the background that all take some level of internet.

Consider Steam for example. Applications like Steam will take a big chunk of your internet whenever they are running in the background. If you are suffering from a laggy stream, try to minimize the background applications and close them if unneeded.

## Part 4\. Discussion: Why Should We Shift To Live Selling?

Live chatting services add more energy to your live events. As discussed, the **WooCommerce online chat** feature is essential to engage with potential customers. Some people still feel doubtful about whether they will get benefits or not. This section clarifies some potential benefits of shifting to live selling that users can get in the overall market:

1. **Build Connections:**Live streams add a human touch in the live selling that connects viewers emotionally. So you can easily build relationships to increase your brand awareness.
2. **Successful Selling:**People can understand what to expect from a product during the live stream. So, it results in successful live selling and reduced delivery returns.
3. **Global Audience:**Unlike traditional selling strategies, live selling helps reach international audiences. You can showcase products or services from anywhere to gain worldwide customers.
4. **Digital Experience:**Live selling is far ahead of the offline world. For this digital experience, shoppers don’t need to find reliable physical stores. Also, the digitalized live shopping experience is more entertaining and profitable.
