## Live Shopping Success Secrets: Unveiling Strategies From Real Case Studies

**Live shopping** has quickly grown in popularity due to the see-no-want-now mentality. Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the **online live shopping** success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping

A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.

### What is live stream shopping?

Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.

![live stream shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg)

One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:

## YouTube Live Selling: Boost Your Sales With These Tips

As more people shop online through live channels, big streaming websites are adding this feature to their platforms. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), a significant site for videos, lets people sell things while they stream live. It is not available as a separate feature but as a part of the regular live-streaming setup on YouTube. This benefits creators because they can sell stuff to their viewers while showcasing their content.

**Live shopping on YouTube** makes it more fun for viewers as well. In this article, we'll talk about how to use YouTube's live selling feature by knowing the eligibility criteria. Furthermore, we will introduce a great tool to improve your live streams.

![live shopping introduced in youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/complete-guide-to-youtube-live-selling-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. How Has YouTube Integrated Live Shopping System Into Its Platform?

YouTube has integrated a live shopping system into its platform. It enables creators to engage with their audiences in real-time to promote and sell products. Creators can set up and connect their own stores or online shopping platforms to YouTube. This involves integrating [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), [Spring](https://spring.io/), or other selected retailers with their YouTube channels.

Also, the sellers have functionalities to tag products within their streams. Viewers can quickly discover and purchase items showcased during the broadcast. Interested users can get guidance and support from the app to manage their live shopping sessions. Plus, **YouTube's live selling** collects feedback from creators and viewers. By doing so, this platform is able to enable continuous improvements.

### Eligibility Criteria of YouTube Live Shopping

If you want to use live selling on YouTube to sell your stuff, you will have to meet the respective eligibility criteria. Users can connect their store to start selling things after fulfilling these guidelines. Provided below are the eligibility criteria required by the YouTube platform for live selling:

1. To perform any live streaming procedure on YouTube, being part of the YouTube Partner Program is necessary.
2. Your channel should have enough subscribers or be recognized as an Official Artist Channel.
3. The videos on your channel shouldn't be mainly for kids. The target age in live shopping covers teenagers and adults, which is why YouTube also focuses on the niche.
4. Your channel shouldn't have any strikes for hate speech. The community guideline strikes should be maintained for the promotion of products.

## Part 2\. How To Use Live Stream Shopping on YouTube?

## Part 1: Essential Preparations Before Beginning Your Twitch Streaming Journey

Whether you're playing games, hosting events, or just chatting, streaming on Twitch is an exciting and rewarding way to engage with your audience in real-time. But to do well on Twitch, you need to prepare properly so your viewers can enjoy watching your content.

To start streaming on Twitch, here's what you'll need:

### Twitch Streaming Software

First, you need to download streaming software for your Twitch video streaming. OBS Studio is the popular one, but Twitch has released its Twitch Studio, which is more beginner-friendly.

1. **OBS Studio**

OBS Studio is a free streaming software that works on any device. You can use it to make your Twitch streams live more attractive by adding alerts, creating starting screens, and using different audio and video sources.

1. **Twitch Studio**

Twitch Studio is the official free streaming application developed to simplify the streaming process for new streamers on Twitch. It offers an intuitive interface and pre-made scenes designed to streamline the user experience.

1. **A device to stream from**

To kickstart your Twitch streaming journey, the first step you need to take is selecting the device from which you'll broadcast. You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.

If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:

* **CPU**

When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.

* **GPU or graphic cards**

Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU's workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.

1. **Microphone**

Although you might get by using a gaming headset's built-in microphone for a bit, it's better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.

1. **Webcam**

If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.

You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.
