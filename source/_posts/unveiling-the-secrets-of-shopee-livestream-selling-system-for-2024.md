## Part 1\. Why is MLB Restricted in Different Regions for Users?

TV viewership of MLB games is declining due to geographical restrictions. Local TV channels purchase the broadcasting rights and impose a blackout policy. This policy restricts the game and makes it unavailable in other regions. In this way, blackouts protect the rights of local broadcasters and live-streaming services.

Moreover, the blackout policy varies according to different factors. They include league agreements, regional broadcasting rights, and teams' home territories. For instance, at least one team is blackout out in every region of the United States. Even some surrounding regions of specific teams also have blackout restrictions. Lowa is the worst blackout out in the USA state, with six teams blacked out.

Due to having limitations, fans are forced to find **MLB streaming sites** to watch matches. By doing so, they can utilize live stream channels to bypass region-locked restrictions.

![live stream shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg)

One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:

## Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream
