## Part 1\. Some Rules and Requirements To Understand Before Live Streaming on Instagram

Like every platform, Instagram has some protocols for broadcasting content to global audiences. Therefore, learning the rules and requirements before going live on Instagram is necessary. First, your account should be at least 30 days old; otherwise, they can restrict your stream.

There is a rule that you can go live for 4 hours per stream without retakes. This length was increased from 60 minutes in the recent update. Also, you can repost a live video on your profile if it is more than 15 minutes long. Instagram allows you to schedule a stream from 1 hour to 90 days in advance.

The initial requirement of **Instagram Live RTMP** is that your content be respectful and updated. Additionally, you need to set your stream to 1920x1080 resolution on a vertical camera. Meanwhile, Instagram gives leverage on the number of followers so that you can start with minimum viewers. Also, there is no need to have a business account for live streaming.

## Part 2\. How To Live Stream to Instagram With an RTMP?

Setting high-quality live streams encourages people to tune into your broadcast. For this purpose, you need a seamless encoder like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). Unfortunately, Instagram doesn't officially support third-party encoders. To solve this query, you need an effective solution.

Therefore, the following steps guide streaming on Instagram with an RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol). You will also learn how to set the required parameters in this comprehensive guide:

* **Step 1.** Start with downloading and launching OBS Studio on your PC. The first thing to do is set up vertical camera dimensions for **RTMP Instagram live** streaming. To access the settings window, hit the “Settings” option in the “Controls” panel.

### Free Streaming Services

First off, here are the **free streaming services** available today. You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don’t worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.

#### Tubi

Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it’s a fair trade-off.

![tubi interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-02.jpg)

#### Peacock

Peacock offers a two-tiered approach. The free tier gives you everything, including movies, shows, popular NBCUniversal titles, news, and sports – but with ads. But the real treasure lies in the Premium subscription ($6 or $12/month). Here, you’ll unlock a vast content library, such as live TV channels. So, consider upgrading for a more comprehensive selection and an ad-free experience.

![peacock interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-03.jpg)

#### Crackle

If you’re a fan of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Crackle is your free portal to their content. However, you can also find other shows that you’ll surely love. While the library is smaller than Tubi and Peacock, it’s an excellent option for Sony enthusiasts. Remember, you’ll encounter ads along the way.
