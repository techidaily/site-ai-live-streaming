![Live HD TV](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/msnbc-live-online-stream-for-the-latest-shows-for-all-devices-2.jpg)

[Live HD TV](https://www.livehdtv.net/msnbc-news/) is amongst the nicest-looking websites on the list. However, it doesn’t just look nice but has a utility that would boost your user experience to the fullest. Aside from MSNBC, there are a plethora of other channels as well like CBC, ABC, CBS, and other news channels.

What’s unique about Live HD TV is that it provides you with multiple servers for MSNBC, which means that you can switch the servers if one of the links is not working. The platform also displays ads minimally, with the player box not showing ads, which basically means that ads are nowhere to be found on this platform. So, if you want to **watch MSNBC live,** then there is no better choice than a platform like Live HD TV.

4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration**: Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

So what exactly is Live Studio? LIVE Studio is TikTok-dedicated streaming software that lets you stream games on TikTok, connect with the community, receive gifts, and subscriptions, and easily create high-quality content for your viewers to enjoy.

So how does it work?

### 01 How does TikTok Live Studio work?

Being a comprehensive live streaming software, creators who want to use Live Studio will need to at least have 1000 followers to unlock and access this wonderful software. TikTok LIVE Studio has helped gaming creators up their TikTok Live experience, experience true monetization, and connect deeply with their viewers.

However, if you want to be a gaming-related creator, you must have posted game-related short videos or gone live while playing a game of your choice. But with non-gamers, the policy is different. You need at least 10,000 followers to have access to the LIVE Studio.

In this article, we introduce Talk Shop Live as a live shopping platform and provide a brief guide on how to start your livestream on the platform.

## Part 1: What is TalkShopLive?

[TalkShopLive](https://talkshop.live/) is a social-selling network for home shopping and live streaming shows. It comes with a built-in buying experience for all kinds of shoppers.

![talk shop live](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/is-talkshoplive-right-for-you-live-shop-pros-tips-before-you-start-1.jpg)

The TalkShopLive studio app for brands and creators brings an array of broadcast and management tools to mobile. The platform boasts of enabling users to promote and sell their shows before and after going live. This means that you can create a shoppable and shareable video for promoting your show even before it goes live. Technically, you do not have to worry about the aftermath since your content will remain shoppable after the live streaming event comes to an end.

You also get to do a whole range of other cool things with Talk Shop Live. With this studio app, you can virtually collaborate with four people in a live stream, simulcast on Facebook, pin comments, and more. The platform is embeddable and shoppable anywhere, allowing you to host shows across platforms.

![talk shop live benefits](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/is-talkshoplive-right-for-you-live-shop-pros-tips-before-you-start-2.jpg)

Here are some specific groups who might find it particularly beneficial:

* **Sellers:** Display item details at the bottom of the screen, track sales while streaming, highlight key products during moments in the show, get access to viewership metrics, and interact with customers in real time.
* **Creators:** Sellers can enlist people on their team to be producers who will work behind the screens. The producer or moderator can be part of the live stream without being on the screen, manage sales, pin lie comments, highlight items, and perform other duties.
* **Customers:** Use the proprietary multi-embedded point-of-sale technology to purchase an item during a live show without interrupting the live shopping experience.

## Part 4: Live Shop Hacks: Unleash AI Power for Sales Success

Choosing TalkShopLive as your live shopping platform keeps you on the right track. In addition to getting access to a wider audience, you also become more competitive in the market. However, it can be time-consuming and expensive to live stream all the time. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) promises a simplified future for sellers and creators. In particular, AI streamers can be used as a powerful tool for live shopping.

AI streamers are avatars that replicate human streamers, keeping your viewers engaged. They offer a unique advantage over traditional human hosts in that they are available 24/7 and work based on your product information. They also have multi-lingua and multi-tasking capabilities that allow you to serve diverse groups of audiences.
