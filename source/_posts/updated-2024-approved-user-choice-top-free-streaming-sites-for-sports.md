Instagram live shopping allowed people to save videos so customers could shop after the broadcast. Using this feature helped companies humanize their brand by telling stories.

According to a [report](https://business.instagram.com/blog/instagram-live-shopping-reach-customers), many Instagram users shopped weekly on the platform. They utilized many features like shopping tags and the “Shop” tab. However, Instagram stopped supporting live shopping on March 16, 2023\. It was decided so that Instagram could focus more on other features of their application.

### Reason for Discontinuing Live Shopping Feature

**Live shopping on Instagram** depends on the product quality. About 55% of the customers reported having this issue with live shopping. There are various other drawbacks to Instagram's live selling feature, which are provided as follows:

1. **More Focus on Other Features:** Instagram wanted to focus on other app features. For this reason, they discontinued live shopping, which required utmost attention.
2. **Declining Engagement:** After the pandemic, online users became less engaged with livestream shopping. So, Instagram shifted its focus to the Reels feature.
3. **Customer Feedback:** The comments and suggestions on the live streams demanded improvements. Also, the **live-selling Instagram** feature did not bear positive comments from the customers.
4. **Lack of Communication:** Sometimes, the online team cannot properly communicate with customers. The lack of communication causes confusion and dissatisfaction among customers.
5. **Limited Availability:** The live shopping Instagram feature had geographical limitations. Various brands couldn’t provide their customers with their products in different places. Moreover, such conditions limit customer access and bring negative comments.

Start by subscribing to a reputable VPN service. Look for providers that offer servers in the UK or Australia. These are the regions where many free World Cup streaming sites are available.

* **Step 2: Install VPN on a computer or smartphone**

Download and install the VPN app on your computer or smartphone. Most VPN providers offer apps for various devices and operating systems, making installation a breeze.

* **Step 3: Connect to the Server in the UK/Australia**

Launch the VPN app and log in with your credentials. Then, choose a server located in the UK or Australia from the server list. Connecting to a server in these regions will give you an IP address from that location. It allows you to bypass geo-restrictions.

* **Step 4: Go to BBC, ITV, or SBS, and start streaming**

Once connected to the VPN server, open your web browser or streaming app. Visit the websites of BBC iPlayer, ITV, or SBS. You can now access free World Cup streaming content and enjoy watching matches live or on-demand.
