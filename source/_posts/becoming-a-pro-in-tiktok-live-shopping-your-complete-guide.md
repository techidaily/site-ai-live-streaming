To start streaming on Twitch, here's what you'll need:

### Twitch Streaming Software

First, you need to download streaming software for your Twitch video streaming. OBS Studio is the popular one, but Twitch has released its Twitch Studio, which is more beginner-friendly.

1. **OBS Studio**

OBS Studio is a free streaming software that works on any device. You can use it to make your Twitch streams live more attractive by adding alerts, creating starting screens, and using different audio and video sources.

1. **Twitch Studio**

To kickstart your Twitch streaming journey, the first step you need to take is selecting the device from which you'll broadcast. You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.

If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:

### Understanding Twitch Streaming Rules

Aside from preparing your streaming gear, you must also understand Twitch streaming rules to avoid any potential violations that could result in penalties or even suspension of your account. Twitch's community guidelines cover a wide range of topics, including harassment, hate speech, copyright infringement, and mature content. You can read the full Twitch streaming rules [here](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Community-Guidelines?language=en%5FUS).

Once you've gathered all the necessary equipment, you can proceed with the following steps to start your Twitch stream.

### How to stream Twitch live on PC or Mac

**Step 1:** Download and install [Twitch Studio](https://www.twitch.tv/broadcast/studio) on your PC or Mac. Then, launch Twitch Studio and log in to your Twitch account. You'll receive a prompt to connect your microphone and webcam.

**Step 2:** Use Twitch Studio to customize your Twitch stream with different scenes and settings. Experiment with these features to find what works best for your livestream.

### How to stream Twitch live on a smartphone

Starting Twitch streaming from your smartphone is a bit different, as the app primarily allows broadcasting from your device's camera. Here's how to live stream on Twitch from your smartphone:

**Step 1:** Download and install the [Twitch App](https://www.twitch.tv/downloads).

**Step 2:** Log in to the Twitch app. Then, go to your profile and tap "Go Live." If you are using newer version of the Twitch app, you can tap “Create.”

![Start Twitch Live on smartphone](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-5.jpg)

You'll then have two options: "Stream Games" or "Stream IRL." The "Stream IRL" will allow you to live stream on Twitch using your phone's camera, while the first option lets you stream mobile games.

![Twitch streaming on smartphone](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-6.jpg)

**Step 3:** Grant access to your camera and/or microphone before starting your stream.

**Step 4:** Set up the stream and Go Live. Give your stream a name, choose a content category, and select the camera you want to use.

Once you've completed these steps, press the "Start Stream" button, and you'll be live on Twitch.

### Key elements of success for streaming on Twitch

While the process for starting Twitch streaming may be similar for all streamers, what makes a streamer successful? Based on reports, there are a few key elements of success for streaming on Twitch.

1. **Engaging content**

Successful Twitch streamers captivate their audience with compelling content that resonates with viewers. This could include entertaining gameplay, informative discussions, or engaging activities. If people like your stream, they might subscribe or donate their money.

1. **Make use of the interactive features**

Twitch stream labs offer unique features like chat rooms and special emojis, fostering interaction between streamers and viewers. Streamers actively engaging with their audience tend to cultivate a loyal and enthusiastic community.

1. **Consistency and persistence**

This is often the toughest part. On Twitch, consistency is crucial. Successful streamers usually maintain regular schedules to make sure their audience knows when to expect new content. If you are new, continuous live streaming can be an effective strategy to engage with your audience consistently and increase your channel's visibility.
