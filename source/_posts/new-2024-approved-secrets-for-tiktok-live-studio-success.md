* Amazon Live is still a fledging service and does not offer influencer marketing nor have its own place on Amazon’s website navigation yet

## Part 2: Step Guidance: Getting Started with Amazon Live

To create a livestream on Amazon, you need to be a U.S. Professional Seller either registered as a U.S. Vendor or in the Amazon Brand Registry. Sellers who meet the requirements can create their livestreams through the [Amazon Live Creator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) mobile app.

![amazon live creator app](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-2.jpg)

With Amazon streaming live service, you can record Livestream in advance and schedule them to go up at a later date or go Live in real-time. This will usually depend on your goals and the kind of interaction you want with your audience. In any case, Amazon recommends the use of an external camera and a video encounter instead of your mobile phone to ensure quality video. Although you can use either, an external camera gives you an edge in terms of quality. Let’s have a look at a detailed step-by-step guide to getting started with Amazon Live:

##### Step 1 Create an Amazon Live Account

Download the [Amazon Live Creator app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) from the Apps Store. The app is currently only available for iOS and will work on iPhone or iPad. Sign into your Seller, Influencer, or Vendor account and create a Live Account.

##### Step 2 Enter Details of your Product or Brand

![products](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/master-amazon-live-features-pro-tips-and-future-trends-5.jpg)

##### Step 4 Set Up Your Amazon Livestream

With the product added, you are ready to set up your live stream. Take some time in the practice mode to familiarize yourself with the platform, and prepare your talking points. Also, come up with responses to possible customer questions and any other important information. Although Amazon Live is free, you can also consider using Amazon advertising to reach a wider audience.

## Conclusion

## Boost Sales with Live Shopping: Learn Winning Strategies From Top Brands

**Live shopping** has quickly grown in popularity due to the see-no-want-now mentality. Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the **online live shopping** success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping

A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.

### What is live stream shopping?

Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.

![live stream shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg)

One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping

A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.

### What is live stream shopping?

Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.

![live stream shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg)

One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:
