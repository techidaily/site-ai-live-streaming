<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Twitch Streaming Software

First, you need to download streaming software for your Twitch video streaming. OBS Studio is the popular one, but Twitch has released its Twitch Studio, which is more beginner-friendly.

1. **OBS Studio**

OBS Studio is a free streaming software that works on any device. You can use it to make your Twitch streams live more attractive by adding alerts, creating starting screens, and using different audio and video sources.

1. **Twitch Studio**

Twitch Studio is the official free streaming application developed to simplify the streaming process for new streamers on Twitch. It offers an intuitive interface and pre-made scenes designed to streamline the user experience.

### Streaming equipment

1. **A device to stream from**

To kickstart your Twitch streaming journey, the first step you need to take is selecting the device from which you'll broadcast. You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.

If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:

* **CPU**

When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.

* **GPU or graphic cards**

Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU's workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.

1. **Microphone**

Although you might get by using a gaming headset's built-in microphone for a bit, it's better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.

1. **Webcam**

If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.

You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration**: Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration**: Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.
