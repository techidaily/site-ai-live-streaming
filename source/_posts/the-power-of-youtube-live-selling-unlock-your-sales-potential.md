Although you can use either, an external camera gives you an edge in terms of quality. Let’s have a look at a detailed step-by-step guide to getting started with Amazon Live:

##### Step 1 Create an Amazon Live Account

Download the [Amazon Live Creator app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-live-creator/id1265170914) from the Apps Store. The app is currently only available for iOS and will work on iPhone or iPad. Sign into your Seller, Influencer, or Vendor account and create a Live Account.

##### Step 2 Enter Details of your Product or Brand

Choose your brand and enter the desired profile name. Edit your profile the way you like to be a true representation of your brand.

##### Step 3 Add Products to Your Livestream

Choose the products you want to add to your livestream. These are the products that you want to promote and use to engage with your viewers.

##### Step 4 Set Up Your Amazon Livestream

With the product added, you are ready to set up your live stream. Take some time in the practice mode to familiarize yourself with the platform, and prepare your talking points. Also, come up with responses to possible customer questions and any other important information. Although Amazon Live is free, you can also consider using Amazon advertising to reach a wider audience.

##### Step 5 Go Live

Once everything is ready, enter your stream time and start time. You can view your analytics from the homepage and see how well the live stream is performing.

Once published, Amazon Live events can be found on the [Amazon.com/Live page](https://www.amazon.com/live). They are also discoverable in Amazon stores, product detail pages, and the Amazon mobile app under “Amazon Live.” A well-presented Amazon Live stream will:

* Build a community by communicating and engaging with consumers
* Entice viewers to take action
* Reduce pre-purchase support requests, such as live chat
* Generate sales
* Lower returns by providing essential details and answers

## Bonus Tip: Enhanced Live Streaming with AI (Future Trends)

[Virbo Live](https://virbo.wondershare.com/live) offers you an ultimate AI streamer experience where you can host live shopping with an AI streamer.
