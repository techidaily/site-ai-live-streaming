![talk shop live beginners](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/is-talkshoplive-right-for-you-live-shop-pros-tips-before-you-start-3.jpg)

As a social selling network, Talk Shop Live is a community of viewers who follow their favorite hosts, discover new products, and connect with other shoppers. Based on TalkShopLive reviews, here are the pros and cons of the platform:

### Pros

1. **Convenient shopping experience**: Shoppers can browse and buy products directly from the livestream.
2. **Interactive and engaging**: Shoppers can ask questions, chat with the host and other viewers, and get product demonstrations
3. **Access to exclusive products and deals**: Sellers can offer special deals and discounts available only during live streams
4. **Discover new products and brands:** Shoppers get real-time recommendations from hosts and influencers.
5. **Sense of a Community**: TalkShopLive fosters a sense of community where users connect

### Cons
