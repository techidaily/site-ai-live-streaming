## Part 2: Step Guidance: Getting Started with Amazon Live

To create a livestream on Amazon, you need to be a U.S. Professional Seller either registered as a U.S. Vendor or in the Amazon Brand Registry.

With Amazon streaming live service, you can record Livestream in advance and schedule them to go up at a later date or go Live in real-time. This will usually depend on your goals and the kind of interaction you want with your audience. In any case, Amazon recommends the use of an external camera and a video encounter instead of your mobile phone to ensure quality video. Although you can use either, an external camera gives you an edge in terms of quality. Let’s have a look at a detailed step-by-step guide to getting started with Amazon Live:

##### Step 1 Create an Amazon Live Account

During the NFL live stream, you’ll want to captivate your audience from kickoff to the final whistle. Engaging visuals, insightful commentary, and seamless transitions are important in keeping your audience hooked.

Try out these strategies to attract your viewers during NFL live streaming:

1. **Make a Pre-game Analysis**

Before the game begins, provide viewers with insightful analysis and predictions about the upcoming match. Discuss key players, recent team performances, and any strategic adjustments that could impact the game's outcome. This pre-game analysis helps build anticipation and engagement among viewers.

1. **Interactive Polls and Q&A Sessions**

You can engage with viewers during the NFL livestream by incorporating interactive elements such as polls and Q&A sessions. Ask viewers to vote on game predictions, MVP candidates, or play of the game. Or, you can encourage viewers to ask questions or share their thoughts in the chat and respond to them to foster interaction and community engagement.

1. **In-game Commentary**

You can provide play-by-play analysis, insights into player performances, and strategic observations throughout the NFL streams. Use visuals such as graphics, replays, and statistics to make your commentary more engaging and improve the viewing experience.

1. **Post-game Analysis and Highlights**

After the game concludes, provide viewers with comprehensive post-game analysis and highlights. Recap key moments, analyze standout performances, and discuss the implications of the game on the team’s season to encourage continued engagement and discussion.

1. **Make Your Channel Discoverable**

Make sure your NFL stream titles clearly state the sport or activity. Use tags like "Football" and add descriptors like "Sidecasting" or "Sports Talk" to give viewers an idea of what to expect.
