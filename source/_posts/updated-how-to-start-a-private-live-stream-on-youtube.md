## Part 1\. Instagram Live Shopping: Things Users Need To Know

Businesses on Instagram used to utilize live broadcasts to sell products directly from the app. It allows them to interact with viewers and drive real-time engagement. Instagram live shopping allowed people to save videos so customers could shop after the broadcast. Using this feature helped companies humanize their brand by telling stories.

According to a [report](https://business.instagram.com/blog/instagram-live-shopping-reach-customers), many Instagram users shopped weekly on the platform. They utilized many features like shopping tags and the “Shop” tab. However, Instagram stopped supporting live shopping on March 16, 2023\. It was decided so that Instagram could focus more on other features of their application.

### Reason for Discontinuing Live Shopping Feature

**Live shopping on Instagram** depends on the product quality. About 55% of the customers reported having this issue with live shopping. There are various other drawbacks to Instagram's live selling feature, which are provided as follows:

1. **More Focus on Other Features:** Instagram wanted to focus on other app features. For this reason, they discontinued live shopping, which required utmost attention.

## Part 1\. Some Rules and Requirements To Understand Before Live Streaming on Instagram

Like every platform, Instagram has some protocols for broadcasting content to global audiences. Therefore, learning the rules and requirements before going live on Instagram is necessary. First, your account should be at least 30 days old; otherwise, they can restrict your stream.

There is a rule that you can go live for 4 hours per stream without retakes. This length was increased from 60 minutes in the recent update.

The initial requirement of **Instagram Live RTMP** is that your content be respectful and updated. Additionally, you need to set your stream to 1920x1080 resolution on a vertical camera. Meanwhile, Instagram gives leverage on the number of followers so that you can start with minimum viewers. Also, there is no need to have a business account for live streaming.

## Part 2\. How To Live Stream to Instagram With an RTMP?
