So how does it work?

## Part 1\. The 10 Best Streaming Video Services

With diverse platforms catering to every taste and budget, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. But worry not, fellow explorer! This part will unveil the best **web streaming services** offering unique strengths and features. Get ready to unlock a world of curated content and personalized recommendations, from Hollywood blockbusters to cult classics, binge-worthy shows, and live sports.

### Free Streaming Services

First off, here are the **free streaming services** available today. You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don’t worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.

#### Tubi

Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it’s a fair trade-off.

![tubi interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-02.jpg)

#### Peacock

Peacock offers a two-tiered approach. The free tier gives you everything, including movies, shows, popular NBCUniversal titles, news, and sports – but with ads. But the real treasure lies in the Premium subscription ($6 or $12/month). Here, you’ll unlock a vast content library, such as live TV channels. So, consider upgrading for a more comprehensive selection and an ad-free experience.

![peacock interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-03.jpg)

#### Crackle

If you’re a fan of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Crackle is your free portal to their content. However, you can also find other shows that you’ll surely love. While the library is smaller than Tubi and Peacock, it’s an excellent option for Sony enthusiasts. Remember, you’ll encounter ads along the way.

![crackle interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-04.jpg)

### Premium Streaming Services

This list will present premium streaming services, meaning the rest of their libraries are not forever accessible with a free plan. Some might offer free trials, but those primarily last for 7 or 30 days – depending on the service.

#### Disney+

Are you craving a magical escape? Disney+ is your portal to the beloved worlds of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic. Enjoy exclusive originals, timeless classics, animated favorites, and captivating documentaries. Perfect for families and those young at heart seeking a sprinkle of pixie dust.

## Part 2: Step Guidance: Getting Started with Amazon Live

To create a livestream on Amazon, you need to be a U.S. Professional Seller either registered as a U.S. Vendor or in the Amazon Brand Registry.

This will usually depend on your goals and the kind of interaction you want with your audience.
