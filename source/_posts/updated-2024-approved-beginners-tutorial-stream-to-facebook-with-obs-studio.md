But the tool displays fewer ads than our conventional cable and there is literally no subscription required. The interesting thing about Tubi is its compatibility. While you can watch most sports shows on the internet, it also supports various platforms like Android, iOS, SONY, LG, Chromecast, and a lot more.

The only downside of using Tubi is that it shows 3 or 4 ads every 15 minutes, which is not too bad. But if we talk about **streaming websites for free sports,** it is still a great platform to watch some of your favorite sports shows.

![Stream2Watch](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/best-12-sports-streaming-sites-for-2024-6.jpg)

 [Stream2Watch](https://play.stream2watch.com/) is a great **sports streaming site for free.** It features various sports like Football, Baseball, Soccer, Tennis, Rugby, and a lot more. However, with a lot of ad pop-ups, the reputation of this website has gone down over the years. But that does not mean it is bad.

The key highlight of Stream2Watch is that it gathers most sports into one platform, allowing you to watch the content of your choice. It is quite a comprehensive website and the speed is decent too, meaning you will only occasionally experience lag.

But if you can cope with the misleading ad pop-ups, then Stream2Watch is ranked highly amongst the **streaming sites with free sports.**

### 7\. Tubi

![Tubi](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/best-12-sports-streaming-sites-for-2024-7.jpg)

[Tubi](https://tubitv.com/) might be more focused on movies and shows, but it also has 10 free stream channels for sports of most categories out there. It has a very user-friendly interface, however, there are still ads that would occasionally come and affect your sports-watching experience.

But the tool displays fewer ads than our conventional cable and there is literally no subscription required. The interesting thing about Tubi is its compatibility. While you can watch most sports shows on the internet, it also supports various platforms like Android, iOS, SONY, LG, Chromecast, and a lot more.

The only downside of using Tubi is that it shows 3 or 4 ads every 15 minutes, which is not too bad. But if we talk about **streaming websites for free sports,** it is still a great platform to watch some of your favorite sports shows.
