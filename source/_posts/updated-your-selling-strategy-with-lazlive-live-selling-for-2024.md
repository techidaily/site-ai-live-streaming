TikTok has realized the power of streaming and is now competing with some of the biggest platforms like Facebook Live, Twitch, and YouTube.

But if you want to grow your TikTok using the Live Studio, then we have a complete guideline of how to go from a beginner streamer to an advanced one.

## Part 1: Basic Knowledge of Pro Tips for TikTok Live Studio Success

![TikTok Studio Live](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/secrets-for-tiktok-live-studio-success-1.jpg)

The studio behind TikTok saw the potential and decided to allow live streaming, which is one of the best ways creators can interact with their audience. However, as the platform got bigger, TikTok introduced its official Live Studio tool that aims to set streamers up for success.

So what exactly is Live Studio? LIVE Studio is TikTok-dedicated streaming software that lets you stream games on TikTok, connect with the community, receive gifts, and subscriptions, and easily create high-quality content for your viewers to enjoy.

So how does it work?

### 01 How does TikTok Live Studio work?

Being a comprehensive live streaming software, creators who want to use Live Studio will need to at least have 1000 followers to unlock and access this wonderful software. TikTok LIVE Studio has helped gaming creators up their TikTok Live experience, experience true monetization, and connect deeply with their viewers.

However, if you want to be a gaming-related creator, you must have posted game-related short videos or gone live while playing a game of your choice. But with non-gamers, the policy is different. You need at least 10,000 followers to have access to the LIVE Studio.

### 02 Benefits and Features of TikTok Live Studio

**Tik Tok LIVE Studio** provides many features that make streaming a breeze. Especially when you are a gamer, you get so many intuitive controls that it turns your TikTok into an analytical dashboard where you can understand your audience a bit better.

Firstly, **Live Studio TikTok** makes it easier for beginners to go live and get their streaming career started. It is simple to use and easy to get started when there is a dedicated tool for streaming.

Secondly, you can engage with viewers like a pro using streaming-oriented features like LIVE, LIVE Goal, Highlight, and more. It sets up a whole system for you to follow and improve, allowing you to take your streaming career to the next level.

Moreover, with TikTok LIVE Studio, you can also chat with your viewers through an in-game chatbox. From reacting to their comments and receiving gifts, Live Studio provides all the options for streamers to leverage.

### 5\. Take care of technical aspects

Most people ignore the technical aspects of TikTok livestream. This is especially true if you want to come in front of the camera for live streaming purposes. For example, you need to make sure that your lighting, sound, and connectivity are perfect so nothing hinders the experience of your audience.
