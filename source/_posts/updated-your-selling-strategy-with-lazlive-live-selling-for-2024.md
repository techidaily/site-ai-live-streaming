### 01 How does TikTok Live Studio work?

Being a comprehensive live streaming software, creators who want to use Live Studio will need to at least have 1000 followers to unlock and access this wonderful software. TikTok LIVE Studio has helped gaming creators up their TikTok Live experience, experience true monetization, and connect deeply with their viewers.

However, if you want to be a gaming-related creator, you must have posted game-related short videos or gone live while playing a game of your choice. But with non-gamers, the policy is different. You need at least 10,000 followers to have access to the LIVE Studio.

[LiveNewsMag](https://www.livenewsmag.com/msnbc-news-live-stream/) has one of the prettiest website designs and it allows you to watch MSNBC Live for free. However, there’s a catch. You will need to experience ads since the website won’t even work even if you have an ad blocker installed and activated.

### 5\. FreeInterTV

![FreeInterTV](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/msnbc-live-online-stream-for-the-latest-shows-for-all-devices-5.jpg)

[FreeInterTV](http://www.freeintertv.com/view/id-2565) is an all-in-one package that also displays MSNBC news online. It is a great platform and a free alternative to the original website. However, the magic of this platform is that it provides you with most TV channels from all across the world.

The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.

#### Features

| **Aspects**         | Performance                      |

[LiveNewsMag](https://www.livenewsmag.com/msnbc-news-live-stream/) has one of the prettiest website designs and it allows you to watch MSNBC Live for free. However, there’s a catch. You will need to experience ads since the website won’t even work even if you have an ad blocker installed and activated.

However, you can join LiveNewsPro which will disable ads for your particular account on the platform. LiveNewsMag provides one of the fastest loading times and although you will be greeted with ads from time to time, you are still getting live news on MSNBC right in the LiveNewsMag platform.

### 5\. FreeInterTV

![FreeInterTV](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/msnbc-live-online-stream-for-the-latest-shows-for-all-devices-5.jpg)

[FreeInterTV](http://www.freeintertv.com/view/id-2565) is an all-in-one package that also displays MSNBC news online. It is a great platform and a free alternative to the original website. However, the magic of this platform is that it provides you with most TV channels from all across the world.

The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.

### Tip 2\. Properly Plan Your Livestream

It won’t be a good impression if you make mistakes in real-time interaction with viewers. Thus, make sure to prepare yourself before going to a live stream. To plan appropriately, collect the data and make an outline or presentation. You can livestream according to outlines and present your products.

### Tip 3\. Gain Expertise in TikTok Features

Becoming a proficient user of TikTok features would be a plus for you. The first feature is its “Enhance” mode, which presents beauty filters to improve your appearance. The flip camera helps show something in front during live without moving the camera away. You can also share your live stream and filter your comments in real-time using TikTok.

### Tip 4\. Check TikTok Analytics

Having a huge number of followers is not enough. You should also analyze when most of your audience stays active for a greater reach. For this, TikTok Analytics helps to supervise the viewers’ activities during specific intervals. Besides, you can also survey viewers to better understand which time is preferable for the maximum audience.
