### 2\. Audio Equipment

Make sure to use an external microphone, as a dedicated one ensures better audio quality. Also, a hands-free microphone makes operability easier for hosts moving around in the live stream.

### 3\. Live Streaming Setup

You must have a computer to handle streaming software and many applications. Use any of the streaming software, but make sure to have a strong internet connection. You also need a platform that supports live-stream shopping, like Facebook or TikTok.

## Boost Sales with Live Shopping: Learn Winning Strategies From Top Brands

**Live shopping** has quickly grown in popularity due to the see-no-want-now mentality. Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the **online live shopping** success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping

A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.

### What is live stream shopping?

Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.

One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.

As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:

### 3\. Promote your live beforehand

Before you go live using TikTok Live Studio, you need to promote your life. It is important to build up anticipation before actually going live on the platform. Hence, when you announce that you are going live and also tease what is going to be in the video, you improve your chances of getting more viewers to join, especially if you have an audience already.

One of the best ways to promote is simply to make an engaging TikTok that only teases the content of your upcoming live session, sparking the curiosity factor amongst the potential viewers.

### 4\. Timing matters the most

The right time when you push out your content is what matters the most. The same is true with YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and most other platforms. With TikTok, you must understand where your audience is mostly active in

How do you find that? Well, you need to understand your audience deeply and when they are mostly active. For example, your audience could be active on TikTok on a certain time and that’s where pushing your livestream will get the most results.

### 5\. Take care of technical aspects

Most people ignore the technical aspects of TikTok livestream. This is especially true if you want to come in front of the camera for live streaming purposes. For example, you need to make sure that your lighting, sound, and connectivity are perfect so nothing hinders the experience of your audience.

With TikTok Live Studio, you can handle the hardware, which devices you want to connect, and the overall quality of your live streams. So, when you address the technical aspects the right way, you increase your chances of engaging the audience.

## Part 3: Step Guidance to Start TikTok Live Studio

##### Step 1 Download TikTok Live Studio

![TikTok Studio Live Guide](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/secrets-for-tiktok-live-studio-success-3.jpg)

Visit the official website of [TikTok Live Studio](https://www.tiktok.com/studio/download?utm%5Fsource=creator%5Fhub&download%5Fsource=creator%5Fhub) and download it for your Windows. But you can also log in to your TikTok account and download Live Studio from there. But if you don’t see the TikTok Live Studio download button in your TikTok app, then that means the software might not be available in your region.

##### Step 2 Install and Login TikTok Live Studio

Once you are logged in, you can either skip the process or Set Up so that everything will go under your supervision. You will need to select things like Microphone, Camera settings, Streaming Settings, and more. Once everything is set up, you just need to click **Go Live,** and your live stream will be started.

## Conclusion

TikTok Live Studio is one of the best live streaming tools you will find. The regular TikTok app is quite limited, especially if you are a streamer trying to make it on the TikTok world.

There is so much competition on the **TikTok streaming service,** but with Live Studio, you get a lot of freedom and tools to measure your progress in the competitive TikTok world.
