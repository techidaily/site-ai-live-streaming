Lowa is the worst blackout out in the USA state, with six teams blacked out.

Due to having limitations, fans are forced to find **MLB streaming sites** to watch matches. By doing so, they can utilize live stream channels to bypass region-locked restrictions.

### What is live stream shopping?

Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.

![live stream shopping](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg)

Visit the official website of [TikTok Live Studio](https://www.tiktok.com/studio/download?utm%5Fsource=creator%5Fhub&download%5Fsource=creator%5Fhub) and download it for your Windows. But you can also log in to your TikTok account and download Live Studio from there. But if you don’t see the TikTok Live Studio download button in your TikTok app, then that means the software might not be available in your region.

##### Step 2 Install and Login TikTok Live Studio

![Login](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/secrets-for-tiktok-live-studio-success-4.jpg)

After completing the download, you need to install the software on your Windows PC or laptop. Give it all the permission that it needs and after you are done installing it on your machine, you need to log in just like you log in to your TikTok. The application will allow you to choose various options like Facebook, Google, and Twitter login.

##### Step 3 Setting up LIVE Studio and going live

![Go Live](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/secrets-for-tiktok-live-studio-success-5.jpg)

Once you are logged in, you can either skip the process or Set Up so that everything will go under your supervision. You will need to select things like Microphone, Camera settings, Streaming Settings, and more. Once everything is set up, you just need to click **Go Live,** and your live stream will be started.

## Conclusion

TikTok Live Studio is one of the best live streaming tools you will find. The regular TikTok app is quite limited, especially if you are a streamer trying to make it on the TikTok world.

There is so much competition on the **TikTok streaming service,** but with Live Studio, you get a lot of freedom and tools to measure your progress in the competitive TikTok world.
