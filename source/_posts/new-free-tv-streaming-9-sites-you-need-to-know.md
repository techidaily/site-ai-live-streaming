To start streaming on Twitch, here's what you'll need:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Twitch Streaming Software

First, you need to download streaming software for your Twitch video streaming. OBS Studio is the popular one, but Twitch has released its Twitch Studio, which is more beginner-friendly.

1. **OBS Studio**

OBS Studio is a free streaming software that works on any device. You can use it to make your Twitch streams live more attractive by adding alerts, creating starting screens, and using different audio and video sources.

1. **Twitch Studio**

Twitch Studio is the official free streaming application developed to simplify the streaming process for new streamers on Twitch. It offers an intuitive interface and pre-made scenes designed to streamline the user experience.

### Streaming equipment

1. **A device to stream from**

To kickstart your Twitch streaming journey, the first step you need to take is selecting the device from which you'll broadcast. You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.

If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:

* **CPU**

When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.

* **GPU or graphic cards**

Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU's workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.

1. **Microphone**

Although you might get by using a gaming headset's built-in microphone for a bit, it's better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.

1. **Webcam**

If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.

You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.

### Understanding Twitch Streaming Rules

Twitch's community guidelines cover a wide range of topics, including harassment, hate speech, copyright infringement, and mature content.

## Part 1\. The 10 Best Streaming Video Services

With diverse platforms catering to every taste and budget, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. But worry not, fellow explorer! This part will unveil the best **web streaming services** offering unique strengths and features. Get ready to unlock a world of curated content and personalized recommendations, from Hollywood blockbusters to cult classics, binge-worthy shows, and live sports.

### Free Streaming Services

First off, here are the **free streaming services** available today. You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don’t worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.

#### Tubi

Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it’s a fair trade-off.

![tubi interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-02.jpg)

#### Peacock

Peacock offers a two-tiered approach. The free tier gives you everything, including movies, shows, popular NBCUniversal titles, news, and sports – but with ads. But the real treasure lies in the Premium subscription ($6 or $12/month). Here, you’ll unlock a vast content library, such as live TV channels. So, consider upgrading for a more comprehensive selection and an ad-free experience.

### Free Streaming Services

First off, here are the **free streaming services** available today. You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don’t worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.

#### Tubi

Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it’s a fair trade-off.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![tubi interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-02.jpg)

#### Peacock

Peacock offers a two-tiered approach. The free tier gives you everything, including movies, shows, popular NBCUniversal titles, news, and sports – but with ads. But the real treasure lies in the Premium subscription ($6 or $12/month). Here, you’ll unlock a vast content library, such as live TV channels. So, consider upgrading for a more comprehensive selection and an ad-free experience.

![peacock interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-03.jpg)

#### Crackle

If you’re a fan of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Crackle is your free portal to their content. However, you can also find other shows that you’ll surely love. While the library is smaller than Tubi and Peacock, it’s an excellent option for Sony enthusiasts. Remember, you’ll encounter ads along the way.

Here are some specific groups who might find it particularly beneficial:

* **Sellers:** Display item details at the bottom of the screen, track sales while streaming, highlight key products during moments in the show, get access to viewership metrics, and interact with customers in real time.
* **Creators:** Sellers can enlist people on their team to be producers who will work behind the screens. The producer or moderator can be part of the live stream without being on the screen, manage sales, pin lie comments, highlight items, and perform other duties.
* **Customers:** Use the proprietary multi-embedded point-of-sale technology to purchase an item during a live show without interrupting the live shopping experience.

Deciding whether TalkShopLive is right for you will depend on your individual shopping habits and preferences. The platform is great for finding deals and discovering new products. It also helps in supporting creators and finding the right products. For sellers and brands, Talk Shop Live reviews indicate that the platform can help reach a wider audience and boost sales.

## Part 4: Live Shop Hacks: Unleash AI Power for Sales Success

Choosing TalkShopLive as your live shopping platform keeps you on the right track. In addition to getting access to a wider audience, you also become more competitive in the market. However, it can be time-consuming and expensive to live stream all the time. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) promises a simplified future for sellers and creators. In particular, AI streamers can be used as a powerful tool for live shopping.

AI streamers are avatars that replicate human streamers, keeping your viewers engaged. They offer a unique advantage over traditional human hosts in that they are available 24/7 and work based on your product information. They also have multi-lingua and multi-tasking capabilities that allow you to serve diverse groups of audiences.
