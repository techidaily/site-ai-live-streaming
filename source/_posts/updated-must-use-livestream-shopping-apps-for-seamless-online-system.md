<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Poor video and audio quality](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-9.jpg)

We all know many online streams have poor video and audio quality. It can be due to a bad internet connection, and if you are streaming from your cellular data, then it can be inconsistent at times, making your viewers angry with the poor video and audio quality.

Choose a lower-resolution setting in your streaming software. Close unnecessary background applications consuming bandwidth. You can also consider investing in a better internet connection. For audio quality, try to invest in a nice microphone as audio quality can make a day and night difference.

![Laggy stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-10.jpg)

### 2\. Poor video and audio quality

![Poor video and audio quality](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-9.jpg)

We all know many online streams have poor video and audio quality. It can be due to a bad internet connection, and if you are streaming from your cellular data, then it can be inconsistent at times, making your viewers angry with the poor video and audio quality.

Choose a lower-resolution setting in your streaming software. Close unnecessary background applications consuming bandwidth. You can also consider investing in a better internet connection. For audio quality, try to invest in a nice microphone as audio quality can make a day and night difference.

Similar to poor video and audio, a laggy stream can occur due to a bad internet connection. Most streamers have a plethora of applications opened in the background that all take some level of internet.

Consider Steam for example. Applications like Steam will take a big chunk of your internet whenever they are running in the background. If you are suffering from a laggy stream, try to minimize the background applications and close them if unneeded.

### 4\. Lack of interaction on stream

### 1\. Write High-Quality Live Stream Content

Before **selling on Instagram Live**, you need a solid live-streaming plan. Users should prepare a quality script that involves information about the product. Also, ensure the content is concise, to the point, and captivating.

### 2\. Create Interactive Online Q&A Sessions

An important tip for a successful **live shopping Instagram** session is customer interaction. This involves holding a live Q&A session to get valuable insight. You can use this information to understand their preferences and interests.

### 3\. Give Sneak Peaks of New Products

You can also provide the audience with various sneak peeks of your product. This builds up anticipation in the audience and marks you as an excellent seller. Also, you can showcase teasers and reveal specific features of your product.

### 4\. Provide Demonstrations and How-To Video Content

Another important tip for live selling on Instagram is product demo video clips. In these videos, you can illustrate the product's function, usage, and benefits. Moreover, sellers can provide step-by-step guides via links that empower them to buy.
