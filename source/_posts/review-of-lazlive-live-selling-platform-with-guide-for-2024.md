### 2\. Pick an Appropriate Date and Time

Another tip to consider is choosing the right time and date for the maximum viewers. In this regard, retailers should avoid a popular shopping period such as Black Friday.

Customers can read the product details and see how it looks, so what difference will they get from a live sale? Considering this perspective, sellers should bring something unique to the shopping stream. For this purpose, they can explain the product's benefits and use cases. Furthermore, they should keep their tone friendly and humorous for the targeted audience.

## Conclusion

To summarize, **livestream sale** **s** is an emerging concept to boost revenue and sales. As shown in this article, it is fruitful for retailers and significantly contributes to generating sales.

To start streaming on Twitch, here's what you'll need:

### Streaming equipment

1. **A device to stream from**

To kickstart your Twitch streaming journey, the first step you need to take is selecting the device from which you'll broadcast. You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.

If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:

* **CPU**

When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.

* **GPU or graphic cards**

Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU's workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.

1. **Microphone**

Although you might get by using a gaming headset's built-in microphone for a bit, it's better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.

1. **Webcam**

If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.

You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.
