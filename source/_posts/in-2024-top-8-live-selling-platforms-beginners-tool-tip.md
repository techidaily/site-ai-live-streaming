The TalkShopLive studio app for brands and creators brings an array of broadcast and management tools to mobile.

Here are some specific groups who might find it particularly beneficial:

* **Creators:** Sellers can enlist people on their team to be producers who will work behind the screens. The producer or moderator can be part of the live stream without being on the screen, manage sales, pin lie comments, highlight items, and perform other duties.
* **Customers:** Use the proprietary multi-embedded point-of-sale technology to purchase an item during a live show without interrupting the live shopping experience.

## Part 4: Live Shop Hacks: Unleash AI Power for Sales Success

Choosing TalkShopLive as your live shopping platform keeps you on the right track. In addition to getting access to a wider audience, you also become more competitive in the market. However, it can be time-consuming and expensive to live stream all the time. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) promises a simplified future for sellers and creators. In particular, AI streamers can be used as a powerful tool for live shopping.

AI streamers are avatars that replicate human streamers, keeping your viewers engaged. They offer a unique advantage over traditional human hosts in that they are available 24/7 and work based on your product information. They also have multi-lingua and multi-tasking capabilities that allow you to serve diverse groups of audiences.
