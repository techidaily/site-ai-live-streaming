Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration**: Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

The use of live commerce features has made significant impacts on business industries. From collaboration with influencers to engaging viewers in consultation, the following brands have transformed their engagement through live online shopping:

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration**: Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 4: Live Shop Hacks: Unleash AI Power for Sales Success

Choosing TalkShopLive as your live shopping platform keeps you on the right track. In addition to getting access to a wider audience, you also become more competitive in the market. However, it can be time-consuming and expensive to live stream all the time. This is where artificial intelligence (AI) promises a simplified future for sellers and creators. In particular, AI streamers can be used as a powerful tool for live shopping.

AI streamers are avatars that replicate human streamers, keeping your viewers engaged. They offer a unique advantage over traditional human hosts in that they are available 24/7 and work based on your product information. They also have multi-lingua and multi-tasking capabilities that allow you to serve diverse groups of audiences.

## Part 1\. The 10 Best Streaming Video Services

With diverse platforms catering to every taste and budget, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. But worry not, fellow explorer! This part will unveil the best **web streaming services** offering unique strengths and features. Get ready to unlock a world of curated content and personalized recommendations, from Hollywood blockbusters to cult classics, binge-worthy shows, and live sports.

### Free Streaming Services

First off, here are the **free streaming services** available today. You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don’t worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.

#### Tubi

Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it’s a fair trade-off.

![tubi interface](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-02.jpg)

#### Peacock

Peacock offers a two-tiered approach. The free tier gives you everything, including movies, shows, popular NBCUniversal titles, news, and sports – but with ads. But the real treasure lies in the Premium subscription ($6 or $12/month). Here, you’ll unlock a vast content library, such as live TV channels. So, consider upgrading for a more comprehensive selection and an ad-free experience.

## Part 2\. Bonus: How To Start a 24/7 On-Demand Live Stream

In today’s digital age, **web streaming services** have become the go-to source for entertainment and information. Services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube have revolutionized how we consume content, offering vast libraries accessible anytime, anywhere. This on-demand approach empowers viewers to watch what they want, when they want, eliminating the constraints of traditional scheduled programming.

However, what about live streaming? While it offers the thrill of real-time interaction and engagement, viewers are often limited by time zones and broadcast schedules. This can restrict your reach and prevent potential viewers from experiencing your content. That’s where innovative tools like Virbo Live come in, bridging the gap between on-demand convenience and live interaction.
