**Pro Tip:** You can use Virbo's AI Script Writer for inspiration. Click on "AI Smart Script" and provide topic details, language preferences, and stylistic choices. Click "Generate" to create a script. Then, you can refine it as needed.

**Step 3:** Customize your AI avatar and background.

Navigate to "AI Avatars" to select an avatar for your live stream. Additionally, you can customize the background, incorporate stickers, or use available templates.
