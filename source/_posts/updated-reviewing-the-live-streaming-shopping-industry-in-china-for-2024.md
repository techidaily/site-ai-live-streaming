## Part 1\. The Basic Concept of Livestream Shopping: What It Is?

Livestream shopping is a practice that involves product promotion through a live video. This innovative concept creates an engaging environment for shopping through live video entertainment.

* Direct communication between streamers and viewers through text, voice, and video channels.
* Safer to be used for live streaming NFL games as it’s more private.

Cons

* Lacks the discoverability of platforms like Twitch and YouTube.
* No built-in monetization options like subscriptions or ads.

For live streaming the game, you can watch the NFL live on various [platforms and services](https://www.nfl.com/ways-to-watch/). Some popular options include NFL+, Streaming Services (YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, Sling TV, and FuboTV), or Broadcast Networks (CBS, FOX, and ESPN). Alternatively, some of the NFL game live stream online free options are USTVGO, FSL, CricFree, and more.

After knowing which streaming platform to use, it’s essential to proceed with caution. Live-streaming NFL games can present various challenges and considerations, including streaming quality, licensing agreements, potential copyright issues, and more.

## Part 2: Strategies to Implement During Live Streaming

Now that you know which platform to use for your sports live-streaming channel, it’s time to strategize your live-streaming approach to maximize audience engagement and make your channel a go-to destination for NFL fans.

During the NFL live stream, you’ll want to captivate your audience from kickoff to the final whistle. Engaging visuals, insightful commentary, and seamless transitions are important in keeping your audience hooked.

Try out these strategies to attract your viewers during NFL live streaming:

1. **Make a Pre-game Analysis**

Before the game begins, provide viewers with insightful analysis and predictions about the upcoming match. Discuss key players, recent team performances, and any strategic adjustments that could impact the game's outcome. This pre-game analysis helps build anticipation and engagement among viewers.

1. **Interactive Polls and Q&A Sessions**

You can engage with viewers during the NFL livestream by incorporating interactive elements such as polls and Q&A sessions. Ask viewers to vote on game predictions, MVP candidates, or play of the game. Or, you can encourage viewers to ask questions or share their thoughts in the chat and respond to them to foster interaction and community engagement.

1. **In-game Commentary**

You can provide play-by-play analysis, insights into player performances, and strategic observations throughout the NFL streams. Use visuals such as graphics, replays, and statistics to make your commentary more engaging and improve the viewing experience.

1. **Post-game Analysis and Highlights**

After the game concludes, provide viewers with comprehensive post-game analysis and highlights. Recap key moments, analyze standout performances, and discuss the implications of the game on the team’s season to encourage continued engagement and discussion.

1. **Make Your Channel Discoverable**

Make sure your NFL stream titles clearly state the sport or activity. Use tags like "Football" and add descriptors like "Sidecasting" or "Sports Talk" to give viewers an idea of what to expect.

You can also personalize your NFL livestream to boost engagement. Add extensions such as alerts and overlays. Use templates from the platform or third-party tools to make your stream unique.

## Part 3: Engaging NFL Fan Viewers with AI Tools

Besides implementing strategies during the NFL live stream, you also need to make your channel discoverable and engage NFL fans to view your channel. The key to this tip is to maintain a constant presence as much as possible.
