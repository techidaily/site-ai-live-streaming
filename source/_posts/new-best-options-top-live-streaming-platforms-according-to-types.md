### 2\. Pick an Appropriate Date and Time

Another tip to consider is choosing the right time and date for the maximum viewers. In this regard, retailers should avoid a popular shopping period such as Black Friday.

Considering this perspective, sellers should bring something unique to the shopping stream. For this purpose, they can explain the product's benefits and use cases. Furthermore, they should keep their tone friendly and humorous for the targeted audience.

After learning about setting up a Facebook shop, you should look into some tips for settling down in the market. Thus, the following are some strategies that you need to focus on before **selling live on Facebook**:

### 1\. Promote Your Shopping Event

Build anticipation of your event a couple of days before. Following that, announce or promote your event and encourage people to subscribe to your page. You can invite them via other channels like Instagram posts, blogs, and social media groups.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Keep It Short and Engaging

Consider the first few minutes of the live event important. Show an energetic attitude and grab the audience's attention initially. According to research, social media users prefer to watch videos in under 1 minute.

### 3\. Plan Things and Be Organized

It is better to plan your points of discussion before the event. You should write the outline and transition lines to shift from one product to another. Besides, keep your surroundings organized to give viewers a good impression.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4\. Energetically Communicate

Make your audience as much involved in the event as you can. For this, it is suggested that they respond to their questions and ask them to comment. You can show your product trials and ask a friend or family to create more engaging discussions.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Don’t Let Your Work Wasted

You should not let your **Facebook live online selling** sessions be wasted. Save it in your timeline for people to watch anytime and get information about items. It will also attract new audiences who couldn't join the live session.
