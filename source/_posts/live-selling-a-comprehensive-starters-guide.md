## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly.

S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market. Businesses that have taken advantage of **live streaming e commerce** report higher conversion rates and increased sales. In this article, we explore the concept of live streaming as successfully applied by different companies and how artificial intelligence is going to further transform this area of business.

## Part 1: Background Information of Live Commerce

To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

![live commerce](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-1.jpg)

To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration**: Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

The use of live commerce features has made significant impacts on business industries. From collaboration with influencers to engaging viewers in consultation, the following brands have transformed their engagement through live online shopping:

### 1\. Michael Kors: Fashionable Collaboration Boosts Engagement

Michael Kors partnered with the popular influencer Aimee Song to host a live stream showcasing their new Spring collection. During the ecommerce live streaming event, Aimee styled various looks while offering insights and answering viewers' questions.

**Achievement:** The e commerce live streaming event garnered over 1 million views and increased website traffic by 300%. Michael Kors recorded that the sales of featured items surpassed expectations, as the dress that Aimee wore was sold out within minutes.

**Lessons Drawn:** Collaborations with relatable influencers can drive significant engagement and sales. The live stream event also demonstrated the importance of interactive elements like styling tips and real-time Q&A in fostering connections and building trust with customers.

### 2\. Sephora: Beauty Unboxed with Community Building

Sephora leveraged streaming commerce to host makeup tutorials, product demonstrations, and expert sessions with brands like Fenty Beauty. During the live commerce event, viewers could purchase products directly from the stream and interact with each other via a live chat.

**Achievement**: The live commerce event boosted Sephora sales by 30% of the featured products. They also saw a 200% rise in engagement on their social media channels, increasing their brand awareness. The live chat fostered a sense of community as viewers could directly share tips and recommendations.

**Lessons Drawn:** Brands can create a powerful formula for success by combining education, entertainment, and community building. Live streaming e commerce provides valuable product information and real-time interactions that can be used to foster loyalty while building lasting communities.

### 3\. Nike: Live Workouts Drive Brand Advocacy

Nike partnered with professional athletes and trainers to host live workout sessions on their app. The live commerce event allowed viewers to participate in the workouts at home, purchase featured Nike apparel and equipment, and interact with other users.

**Lessons Drawn:** Live stream commerce can go beyond mere product promotion by offering valuable experiences like workouts. By adding interactive elements and community engagement, sellers can fuel their brand advocacy and create loyal customers.

### 4\. L'Oreal: Personalized Skincare Consultations

L'Oreal launched a live consultation service within its app. The live commerce feature allowed users to connect with dermatologists and beauty advisors for personalized skincare recommendations. They would then purchase recommended products directly from the consultation.

![l’oreal](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-commerce-next-chapter-can-ai-unlock-its-true-potential-5.jpg)

**Achievement:** The live consultations increased app usage by 50% and grew sales of recommended products by 35%. The e-commerce live-streaming event saw users appreciate the personalized advice they got and a seamless purchasing experience.

**Lessons Drawn:** Live commerce can be more than entertainment by offering valuable services like consultations. By engaging in personalized experiences, brands can increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, contributing to conversions and repeat purchases.
