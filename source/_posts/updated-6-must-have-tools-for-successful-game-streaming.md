## Part 1\. A Basic Preview To "Live Shopping"

**Livestream selling** or live shopping refers to live product demonstrations on digital platforms. The retailer or host has to introduce themselves, their store, and sale before describing products. They explain each detail of the products and their prices while holding them in a direct video call. During that, ensure that followers can see the product and interact through comments.

Customers perceive it as a lively shopping experience instead of websites loading products. It creates a sense of connection as people feel like shopping in physical stores. As **live selling** has a core element of being in real time, people can question and know about the product. Compared with traditional shopping, one can place an order through links mentioned in the livestream.

With live selling, customers can view the products and ask questions during the live sessions. Therefore, it lowers the return rates to 40% while increasing customer satisfaction and trust.

#### 3\. Potential Growth and Virtual Demonstrations

This online shopping mode has the potential to upscale your business. According to a survey, companies can see top-line growth upward of 25% through live selling.
