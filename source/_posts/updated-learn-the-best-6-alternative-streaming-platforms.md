### 4\. Lack of interaction on stream

Like every platform, Instagram has some protocols for broadcasting content to global audiences. Therefore, learning the rules and requirements before going live on Instagram is necessary. First, your account should be at least 30 days old; otherwise, they can restrict your stream.

There is a rule that you can go live for 4 hours per stream without retakes. This length was increased from 60 minutes in the recent update.

The initial requirement of **Instagram Live RTMP** is that your content be respectful and updated. Additionally, you need to set your stream to 1920x1080 resolution on a vertical camera. Meanwhile, Instagram gives leverage on the number of followers so that you can start with minimum viewers. Also, there is no need to have a business account for live streaming.

## Part 2\. How To Live Stream to Instagram With an RTMP?

Setting high-quality live streams encourages people to tune into your broadcast. For this purpose, you need a seamless encoder like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). Unfortunately, Instagram doesn't officially support third-party encoders. To solve this query, you need an effective solution.

Then, hit the “OK” button to apply these changes to your Instagram streams.
