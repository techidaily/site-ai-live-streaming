## Part 4: Live Shop Hacks: Unleash AI Power for Sales Success

They also have multi-lingua and multi-tasking capabilities that allow you to serve diverse groups of audiences.

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms.

To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.
