Sellers can use **Amazon Live streaming** to drive trading and brand awareness of their products. In this article, we explore the **Amazon Live streaming shopping** experience including the key features and pro tips.

## Part 1: Live on Amazon: A Game-Changer for Sellers

Amazon has been hosting many live streams where sellers promote a wide range of products. With Amazon Live Events, thousands of creators and influencers sell products and demonstrate how they work. This type of livestream shopping is an effective marketing strategy. It allows a personable host to demonstrate products while shoppers talk about their experience and ask any burning questions.

### 01 What is Amazon Live Streaming?

Amazon Live Streaming is an interactive fee that allows brands to show live videos for their products. You can introduce your brands to the audience and demonstrate how products work. With Amazon Live, sellers highlight their product listings and create banners for customers using product promotions on a carousel below each live video. On the other hand, customers interact with the live video by asking questions in the comment sections or chatting with hosts.

## Part 2: Step Guidance: Getting Started with Amazon Live

To create a livestream on Amazon, you need to be a U.S. Professional Seller either registered as a U.S. Vendor or in the Amazon Brand Registry.

With Amazon streaming live service, you can record Livestream in advance and schedule them to go up at a later date or go Live in real-time. This will usually depend on your goals and the kind of interaction you want with your audience. In any case, Amazon recommends the use of an external camera and a video encounter instead of your mobile phone to ensure quality video. Although you can use either, an external camera gives you an edge in terms of quality. Let’s have a look at a detailed step-by-step guide to getting started with Amazon Live:

##### Step 1 Create an Amazon Live Account

![LiveNewsChat](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/msnbc-live-online-stream-for-the-latest-shows-for-all-devices-1.jpg)

[LiveNewsChat](https://livenewschat.eu/politics/) is one of the most comprehensive and fastest websites if you want to watch the live stream of MSNBC. When it comes to **MSNBC Live**, this website allows you to watch your favorite shows on the device of your choice.

For example, if you are using your mobile, then you can simply visit the website from our link and play the video player. Similarly, if you are on the web, you can open the website and start watching some of your favorite shows right away.

What’s amazing about LiveNewsChat is that it is simple to use. You don’t get many unique design aesthetics or amazing user interfaces. When you go into the app, you will be greeted with the **MSNBC Live stream** box that you can use to click and start watching shows right away.

One aspect of LiveNewsChat that we did not like is that it has a lot of annoying pop-up ads. But the quality pays for the hindered user experience which makes LiveNewsChat one of the best platforms for **MSNBC live streaming free online.**

[Live HD TV](https://www.livehdtv.net/msnbc-news/) is amongst the nicest-looking websites on the list. However, it doesn’t just look nice but has a utility that would boost your user experience to the fullest.

There are advanced options too that are related to ad control, latency, and more. So, if you are ever having a problem on the platform, you can manually fix it. All in all, STREAMFARE is one of the best **MSNBC live streams free online** that you can experience and have fun watching.

[LiveNewsMag](https://www.livenewsmag.com/msnbc-news-live-stream/) has one of the prettiest website designs and it allows you to watch MSNBC Live for free. However, there’s a catch.

[FreeInterTV](http://www.freeintertv.com/view/id-2565) is an all-in-one package that also displays MSNBC news online. It is a great platform and a free alternative to the original website. However, the magic of this platform is that it provides you with most TV channels from all across the world.

The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.
