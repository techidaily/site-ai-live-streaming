S**treaming commerce** has become popular and brands are looking for the best live tools to push their products in the market.

To get started, let’s define what is live ecommerce. Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?

### 01 What is Live Commerce?

Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms.

In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.

To be successful with live e commerce, you would need certain tools like a live shopping platform, shopping cart integration, and live chat to give your viewers the ultimate user experience. This allows consumers to watch, talk, and shop your products from wherever they are and at any time.

### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly.

### 5\. Promote your broadcast

![Promote your broadcast](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-6.jpg)

We live in an attention economy where hype is everything. If you look at some of the biggest live streamers, they create so much hype that people from all over the web would be curious enough to leave what they are doing and watch their streams. There are two main aspects to it.

First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.

But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.

### 6\. Collaboration

![Collaboration](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-7.jpg)

If you look closely, we have multiple streamers connecting with each other and having fun together. For example, Fouseytube sometimes connects with Sneako and both of them then go to N3on to make the biggest live stream in the history of social media.

### 2\. Poor video and audio quality

![Poor video and audio quality](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-9.jpg)

We all know many online streams have poor video and audio quality. It can be due to a bad internet connection, and if you are streaming from your cellular data, then it can be inconsistent at times, making your viewers angry with the poor video and audio quality.

Choose a lower-resolution setting in your streaming software. Close unnecessary background applications consuming bandwidth. You can also consider investing in a better internet connection. For audio quality, try to invest in a nice microphone as audio quality can make a day and night difference.

### 3\. Laggy stream

![Laggy stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-10.jpg)

Similar to poor video and audio, a laggy stream can occur due to a bad internet connection. Most streamers have a plethora of applications opened in the background that all take some level of internet.

Consider Steam for example. Applications like Steam will take a big chunk of your internet whenever they are running in the background. If you are suffering from a laggy stream, try to minimize the background applications and close them if unneeded.

### 4\. Lack of interaction on stream

![Lack of interaction on stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-11.jpg)

A lot of people suffer from a lack of interaction even if they have slowly started to build a respectable viewer count. So, what should you do in that situation? Actively engage with viewers by responding to comments, asking questions, and running polls/contests.

Encourage viewers to interact with each other. Invite guests or co-hosts to add diverse perspectives. You should always be trying something new that would excite the viewers into taking part.

If you are a new creator who is looking to make his mark as a successful streamer, then you should capitalize on what already seems to be working. Most creators make this fatal mistake when they try to invent something new, earlier in their streaming career.

However, you need to have a loyal audience in order to do so. People use YouTube to get information or some sort of entertainment. Whether you are a new creator or someone who already has a set audience, your main focus should be to discuss hot topics or play trending games to get views faster and efficiently.

That is exactly your ticket to success. First, you need to understand the problems that your audience has. How can you solve them? What concerns do they have on a particular topic? Then, you need to go live, add the right description, choose tags, and talk about that particular topic to gain traction from people all over the world.

It seems like YouTube also pushes live content which means live creators have an edge compared to the ones that don’t go live.

### 4\. Building a community

![Promote your broadcast](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-6.jpg)

We live in an attention economy where hype is everything. If you look at some of the biggest live streamers, they create so much hype that people from all over the web would be curious enough to leave what they are doing and watch their streams. There are two main aspects to it.

First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.

But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.

### 6\. Collaboration

![Collaboration](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-7.jpg)

Once you grow a little bit, you can collaborate with other streamers to join two audiences together. If you look closely, we have multiple streamers connecting with each other and having fun together. For example, Fouseytube sometimes connects with Sneako and both of them then go to N3on to make the biggest live stream in the history of social media.

### 2\. Poor video and audio quality

![Poor video and audio quality](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-9.jpg)

We all know many online streams have poor video and audio quality. It can be due to a bad internet connection, and if you are streaming from your cellular data, then it can be inconsistent at times, making your viewers angry with the poor video and audio quality.

Choose a lower-resolution setting in your streaming software. Close unnecessary background applications consuming bandwidth. You can also consider investing in a better internet connection. For audio quality, try to invest in a nice microphone as audio quality can make a day and night difference.

### 3\. Laggy stream

![Laggy stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-10.jpg)

Similar to poor video and audio, a laggy stream can occur due to a bad internet connection. Most streamers have a plethora of applications opened in the background that all take some level of internet.

Consider Steam for example. Applications like Steam will take a big chunk of your internet whenever they are running in the background. If you are suffering from a laggy stream, try to minimize the background applications and close them if unneeded.

### 4\. Lack of interaction on stream

![Lack of interaction on stream](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/transform-youtube-live-with-these-must-know-secrets-11.jpg)

A lot of people suffer from a lack of interaction even if they have slowly started to build a respectable viewer count. So, what should you do in that situation? Actively engage with viewers by responding to comments, asking questions, and running polls/contests.

Encourage viewers to interact with each other. Invite guests or co-hosts to add diverse perspectives. You should always be trying something new that would excite the viewers into taking part.
