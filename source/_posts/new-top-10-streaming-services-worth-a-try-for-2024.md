## Part 3\. Some Progressive Tips To Excel in Facebook Live Shopping

After learning about setting up a Facebook shop, you should look into some tips for settling down in the market. Thus, the following are some strategies that you need to focus on before **selling live on Facebook**:

### 1\. Promote Your Shopping Event

Build anticipation of your event a couple of days before. Following that, announce or promote your event and encourage people to subscribe to your page. You can invite them via other channels like Instagram posts, blogs, and social media groups.

### 2\. Keep It Short and Engaging

Consider the first few minutes of the live event important. Show an energetic attitude and grab the audience's attention initially. According to research, social media users prefer to watch videos in under 1 minute.

### 3\. Plan Things and Be Organized

It is better to plan your points of discussion before the event. You should write the outline and transition lines to shift from one product to another. Besides, keep your surroundings organized to give viewers a good impression.

### 4\. Energetically Communicate

Make your audience as much involved in the event as you can. For this, it is suggested that they respond to their questions and ask them to comment. You can show your product trials and ask a friend or family to create more engaging discussions.

[FreeInterTV](http://www.freeintertv.com/view/id-2565) is an all-in-one package that also displays MSNBC news online. It is a great platform and a free alternative to the original website. However, the magic of this platform is that it provides you with most TV channels from all across the world.

The loading speeds are insanely fast but the quality does suffer depending on your internet connection. Unlike a couple of previous websites we have mentioned before, FreeInterTV does not allow you to change the quality according to your liking.

Moreover, you also do not have the ability to choose servers, which can be problematic especially when there are too many people watching on the single server.
