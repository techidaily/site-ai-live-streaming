### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration**: Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.
