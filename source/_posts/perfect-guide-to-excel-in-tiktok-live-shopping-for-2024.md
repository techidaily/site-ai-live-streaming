### Free Streaming Services

First off, here are the **free streaming services** available today. You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don’t worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.

#### Tubi

Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it’s a fair trade-off.

## Part 1\. Why is MLB Restricted in Different Regions for Users?

TV viewership of MLB games is declining due to geographical restrictions. Local TV channels purchase the broadcasting rights and impose a blackout policy. This policy restricts the game and makes it unavailable in other regions. In this way, blackouts protect the rights of local broadcasters and live-streaming services.

Moreover, the blackout policy varies according to different factors. They include league agreements, regional broadcasting rights, and teams' home territories. For instance, at least one team is blackout out in every region of the United States. Even some surrounding regions of specific teams also have blackout restrictions. Lowa is the worst blackout out in the USA state, with six teams blacked out.

Due to having limitations, fans are forced to find **MLB streaming sites** to watch matches. By doing so, they can utilize live stream channels to bypass region-locked restrictions.
