## Part 1\. Some Rules and Requirements To Understand Before Live Streaming on Instagram

Like every platform, Instagram has some protocols for broadcasting content to global audiences. Therefore, learning the rules and requirements before going live on Instagram is necessary. First, your account should be at least 30 days old; otherwise, they can restrict your stream.

There is a rule that you can go live for 4 hours per stream without retakes. This length was increased from 60 minutes in the recent update.
