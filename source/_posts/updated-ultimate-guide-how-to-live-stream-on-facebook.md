### 02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live

The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.

Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:

1. **Sales Acceleration**: Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes
2. **Promotes Better Engagement:** With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.
3. **Encourages Impulse Buying:** People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.
4. **Builds Brand Awareness:** Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.

## Part 2: Successful Case in Live Online Shopping: Transforming Brands through Engagement

#### 6\. Microphone Integration for Voice-Driven AI

Get your AI-powered avatar to speak in real time by connecting and speaking into the microphone. What you speak into the microphone is automatically replicated by the AI streamer during the event.

#### 7\. Interaction Through Text

Trigger and get your AI streamer to speak based on your own written text. You only need to enter the text that you want and click Send. The AI streamer will then speech what you have typed.

#### 8\. Cloud-Based Operation

Virbo Live offers you more freedom with the cloud-based operation. All the features are available online, and you do not have to struggle downloading any software. Operate directly from the cloud and freely manage your product.

## Conclusion

TalkShopLive offers sellers and shoppers a unique experience to sell and buy products during live shows. The platform is specially designed to help in the distribution, collaboration, and sharing of a truly shoppable and social video experience.

As a social-selling network, Talk Shop Live allows users to interact with each other and make informed purchase decisions. However, hiring a human streamer and preparing their content can be time-consuming and expensive. That’s why we recommend [Virbo Live](https://virbo.wondershare.com/virbo-live.html) as the future of live-stream shopping. Get access to AI-powered avatars that will keep your viewers engaged while boosting your revenue from live-stream events.
