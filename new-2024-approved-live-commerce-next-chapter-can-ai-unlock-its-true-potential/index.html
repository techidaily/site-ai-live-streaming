<p>If you are a new creator who is looking to make his mark as a successful streamer, then you should capitalize on what already seems to be working. Most creators make this fatal mistake when they try to invent something new, earlier in their streaming career.</p>
<p>However, you need to have a loyal audience in order to do so. People use YouTube to get information or some sort of entertainment. Whether you are a new creator or someone who already has a set audience, your main focus should be to discuss hot topics or play trending games to get views faster and efficiently.</p>
<p>To make it easier for you, let’s say that a new game rolls out. By discussing the game or playing the game on live stream, you are going to attract the right audience according to your YouTube channel and gain followers instead of being clueless.</p>

<p>Yes! It is possible to rank videos on the go as you go live. By doing YouTube research, you can leverage different keywords and rank for them as you go online. Most people make evergreen videos and put pre-recorded ones but compared to them, the live world is still small.</p>
<p>That is exactly your ticket to success. First, you need to understand the problems that your audience has. How can you solve them? What concerns do they have on a particular topic? Then, you need to go live, add the right description, choose tags, and talk about that particular topic to gain traction from people all over the world.</p>
<p>It seems like YouTube also pushes live content which means live creators have an edge compared to the ones that don’t go live.</p>

<p>With other tips on the list, you must be vary of how important your audience is especially when it comes to YouTube Live. The third secret and one of the most important <strong>YouTube streaming guidelines</strong> is building a community.</p>
<p>As you build your live community, you will have audience retention, meaning more people will come to you whenever you go live. You need to understand your audience deeply, what time you get the most viewers, and what interests your audience.</p>
<p>Once you do that, you also need to talk to them as they come live. Build deep connections with your viewers and you will see a huge increase in your subscribers and overall viewer count.</p>

<p>We live in an attention economy where hype is everything. If you look at some of the biggest live streamers, they create so much hype that people from all over the web would be curious enough to leave what they are doing and watch their streams. There are two main aspects to it.</p>
<p>First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.</p>
<p>But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.</p>

<p>Once you grow a little bit, you can collaborate with other streamers to join two audiences together. If you look closely, we have multiple streamers connecting with each other and having fun together. For example, Fouseytube sometimes connects with Sneako and both of them then go to N3on to make the biggest live stream in the history of social media.</p>
<p>When you collaborate with someone and entertain the audience in a way that they want to be, You need to not only build a community of people but also collaborate with other streamers which will open new aspects of your streaming journey.</p>

<p>One of the most common problems with YouTube Live is streams not starting. Imagine you have an audience of people waiting but the stream just does not start. It can be unresponsive, which is a common issue with YouTube Live.</p>
<p>Here’s what you can do to fix the issue. Firstly, you need to verify your account and wait for 24 hours for this issue to be fixed. It is because new channels need this type of verification to allow you to start streaming.</p>
<p>However, if that still doesn’t fix the issue, you should try restarting your streaming service and computer. After a good reset, you can start streaming again and it should get you up and running.</p>

                ></p>
<p>We all know many online streams have poor video and audio quality. It can be due to a bad internet connection, and if you are streaming from your cellular data, then it can be inconsistent at times, making your viewers angry with the poor video and audio quality.</p>
<p>Choose a lower-resolution setting in your streaming software. Close unnecessary background applications consuming bandwidth. You can also consider investing in a better internet connection. For audio quality, try to invest in a nice microphone as audio quality can make a day and night difference.</p>

<p>Consider Steam for example. Applications like Steam will take a big chunk of your internet whenever they are running in the background. If you are suffering from a laggy stream, try to minimize the background applications and close them if unneeded.</p>

<p>If you are a new creator who is looking to make his mark as a successful streamer, then you should capitalize on what already seems to be working. Most creators make this fatal mistake when they try to invent something new, earlier in their streaming career.</p>
<p>However, you need to have a loyal audience in order to do so. People use YouTube to get information or some sort of entertainment. Whether you are a new creator or someone who already has a set audience, your main focus should be to discuss hot topics or play trending games to get views faster and efficiently.</p>
<p>To make it easier for you, let’s say that a new game rolls out. By discussing the game or playing the game on live stream, you are going to attract the right audience according to your YouTube channel and gain followers instead of being clueless.</p>

Then, you need to go live, add the right description, choose tags, and talk about that particular topic to gain traction from people all over the world.</p>
<p>It seems like YouTube also pushes live content which means live creators have an edge compared to the ones that don’t go live.</p>

<p>We live in an attention economy where hype is everything. If you look at some of the biggest live streamers, they create so much hype that people from all over the web would be curious enough to leave what they are doing and watch their streams. There are two main aspects to it.</p>
<p>First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.</p>
<p>But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.</p>

<p>Once you grow a little bit, you can collaborate with other streamers to join two audiences together.

For example, Fouseytube sometimes connects with Sneako and both of them then go to N3on to make the biggest live stream in the history of social media.</p>
<p>When you collaborate with someone and entertain the audience in a way that they want to be, You need to not only build a community of people but also collaborate with other streamers which will open new aspects of your streaming journey.</p>

But to do well on Twitch, you need to prepare properly so your viewers can enjoy watching your content.</p>
<p>To start streaming on Twitch, here’s what you’ll need:</p>
<h3 id="Twitch-Streaming-Software"><a href="#Twitch-Streaming-Software" class="headerlink" title="Twitch Streaming Software"></a>Twitch Streaming Software</h3><p>First, you need to download streaming software for your Twitch video streaming. OBS Studio is the popular one, but Twitch has released its Twitch Studio, which is more beginner-friendly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>OBS Studio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>OBS Studio is a free streaming software that works on any device. You can use it to make your Twitch streams live more attractive by adding alerts, creating starting screens, and using different audio and video sources.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Twitch Studio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Twitch Studio is the official free streaming application developed to simplify the streaming process for new streamers on Twitch. It offers an intuitive interface and pre-made scenes designed to streamline the user experience.</p>
<h3 id="Streaming-equipment"><a href="#Streaming-equipment" class="headerlink" title="Streaming equipment"></a>Streaming equipment</h3><ol>
<li><strong>A device to stream from</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To kickstart your Twitch streaming journey, the first step you need to take is selecting the device from which you’ll broadcast. You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.</p>
<p>If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GPU or graphic cards</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU’s workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Microphone</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Although you might get by using a gaming headset’s built-in microphone for a bit, it’s better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Webcam</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.</p>
<p>You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.</p>

Based on reports, there are a few key elements of success for streaming on Twitch.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Engaging content</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Successful Twitch streamers captivate their audience with compelling content that resonates with viewers. This could include entertaining gameplay, informative discussions, or engaging activities. If people like your stream, they might subscribe or donate their money.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make use of the interactive features</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Twitch stream labs offer unique features like chat rooms and special emojis, fostering interaction between streamers and viewers. Streamers actively engaging with their audience tend to cultivate a loyal and enthusiastic community.</p>
