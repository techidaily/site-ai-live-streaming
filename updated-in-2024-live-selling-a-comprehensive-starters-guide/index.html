                      alt="Login"
                ></p>
<p>After completing the download, you need to install the software on your Windows PC or laptop. Give it all the permission that it needs and after you are done installing it on your machine, you need to log in just like you log in to your TikTok. The application will allow you to choose various options like Facebook, Google, and Twitter login.</p>

                      alt="Go Live"
                ></p>
<p>Once you are logged in, you can either skip the process or Set Up so that everything will go under your supervision. You will need to select things like Microphone, Camera settings, Streaming Settings, and more. Once everything is set up, you just need to click <strong>Go Live,</strong> and your live stream will be started.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-11"><a href="#Conclusion-11" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>TikTok Live Studio is one of the best live streaming tools you will find. The regular TikTok app is quite limited, especially if you are a streamer trying to make it on the TikTok world.</p>
<p>There is so much competition on the <strong>TikTok streaming service,</strong> but with Live Studio, you get a lot of freedom and tools to measure your progress in the competitive TikTok world.</p>
