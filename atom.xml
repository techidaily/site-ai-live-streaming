The 10 Best Streaming Video Services"></a>Part 1. The 10 Best Streaming Video Services</h2><p>With diverse platforms catering to every taste and budget, choosing the right one can feel overwhelming. But worry not, fellow explorer! This part will unveil the best <strong>web streaming services</strong> offering unique strengths and features. Get ready to unlock a world of curated content and personalized recommendations, from Hollywood blockbusters to cult classics, binge-worthy shows, and live sports.</p><h3 id="Free-Streaming-Services-1"><a href="#Free-Streaming-Services-1" class="headerlink" title="Free Streaming Services"></a>Free Streaming Services</h3><p>First off, here are the <strong>free streaming services</strong> available today. You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don’t worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.</p><h4 id="Tubi-1"><a href="#Tubi-1" class="headerlink" title="Tubi"></a>Tubi</h4><p>Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it’s a fair trade-off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-02.jpg"                      alt="tubi interface"                ></p><h4 id="Peacock-1"><a href="#Peacock-1" class="headerlink" title="Peacock"></a>Peacock</h4><p>Peacock offers a two-tiered approach. The free tier gives you everything, including movies, shows, popular NBCUniversal titles, news, and sports – but with ads. But the real treasure lies in the Premium subscription ($6 or $12&#x2F;month). Here, you’ll unlock a vast content library, such as live TV channels. So, consider upgrading for a more comprehensive selection and an ad-free experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-03.jpg"                      alt="peacock interface"                ></p><h4 id="Crackle-1"><a href="#Crackle-1" class="headerlink" title="Crackle"></a>Crackle</h4><p>If you’re a fan of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Crackle is your free portal to their content. However, you can also find other shows that you’ll surely love. While the library is smaller than Tubi and Peacock, it’s an excellent option for Sony enthusiasts. Remember, you’ll encounter ads along the way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-04.jpg"                      alt="crackle interface"                ></p><h3 id="Premium-Streaming-Services-1"><a href="#Premium-Streaming-Services-1" class="headerlink" title="Premium Streaming Services"></a>Premium Streaming Services</h3><p>This list will present premium streaming services, meaning the rest of their libraries are not forever accessible with a free plan.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> A standing desk isn’t complete without a standing desk mat, at least not if you value your comfort. We tried out the Topo by Ergodriven Standing Desk Mat, testing it for comfort, design, and performance. We decided to test it for a few hours a day over the course of a week to see how it worked.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KYfJPJ0jHZhmy15IUeGxDL8kmRw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Ergodriven-Topo-Comfort-Mat-2-547d9823c4ac47cbb5a360040866172a.jpg"                      alt="Ergodriven Topo Standing Desk Mat"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><h2 id="Design-Simply-modern"><a href="#Design-Simply-modern" class="headerlink" title="Design: Simply modern"></a><strong>Design: Simply modern</strong></h2><p> At 26.2 inches by 29 inches (LW), the Topo is a fairly wide mat, giving the user lots of berth to shift around. It comes with two power wedges in the back with calf-stretching inclines in the front that end up going 2.7 inches high, though the bottom platform of the mat is much thinner. It also comes with a massage mound in the center of the mat. For the most part, we liked the mat, but placing the massage mound in the center we felt was detrimental for standing space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/0MLp0JKyXodrqDxUdun30XlUicQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Ergodriven-Topo-Comfort-Mat-3-5e85cbed72974e018684fe954f0ddf1b-75abe4f41eba41c3b202cdf74fbf3caa.jpg"                      alt="Ergodriven Topo Standing Desk Mat"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Rebecca Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043596/7443" target="_top" id="2043596">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043596" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043596/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Flawed-but-still-solid"><a href="#Performance-Flawed-but-still-solid" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Flawed, but still solid"></a><strong>Performance: Flawed, but still solid</strong></h2><p> As we previously stated, one of the features of this mat is the massage mound in the center. When we first stepped onto the mat, we really disliked how we couldn’t shift without bumping the massage mound. It’s a great feature if you want to change your ankle stances or relieve your foot pain. However, if you’re standing on the mat for extended hours at a time, your feet are stuck off to the sides and you really can’t shift around as time progresses.</p><p> For the most part, we liked the mat, but placing the massage mound in the center, we felt was detrimental for standing space.</p><p> That said, other features of the mat are spectacular. The front wedges are designed to stretch your calves. When we used them throughout the day, they really helped to relieve the tightness from extended standing periods. Though we did feel they were a steeper incline than other mats we’ve recently tested.</p><p> Another great feature is the rear power wedges. While technically it’s one large wedge, there’s a small groove you can rest your heel to change up your stretches as the day passes by. It’s steeper than other models we tested. The steeper incline was better in many ways because it gave us a more intense hamstring stretch. It was a great way to get the blood circulating.</p><p> While technically it’s one large wedge, there’s a small groove in which you can rest your heel to change up your stretches as the day passes by.</p><p> We also liked how the mat slides around on various surfaces, but it’s not too slippery. We hauled it around to various offices with tile and carpet. Each time we set it down, we could push it under the desk with ease if we needed to sit for extended lengths of time and pull it out just as easily when we wanted to stand.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134491/18498" target="_top" id="2134491">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134491" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134491/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-Pretty-steep-for-a-mat"><a href="#Price-Pretty-steep-for-a-mat" class="headerlink" title="Price: Pretty steep for a mat"></a><strong>Price: Pretty steep for a mat</strong></h2><p> At around $100 on Amazon, the Topo is in the higher price range for a standing desk mat. We could find models that don’t have the massage mound in the center, however, the steep power wedges in the back make it a reasonable investment for anyone who really wants to stretch out their legs.</p><p> For a standing desk mat with some exercise features, the Ergodriven Topo is a fairly decent choice.</p><h2 id="Topo-Ergodriven-vs-CubeFit-TerraMat"><a href="#Topo-Ergodriven-vs-CubeFit-TerraMat" class="headerlink" title="Topo Ergodriven vs. CubeFit TerraMat"></a><strong>Topo Ergodriven vs. CubeFit TerraMat</strong></h2><p> We decided to compare the Ergodriven Topo against CubeFit’s TerraMat. Price-wise, they’re very similar, retailing around $100. They also come with massage mounds and various power wedges. However, the TerraMat has more features on the mat itself, including a balance bar and plantar mounds off to the sides, as well as a massage mound in the front. None of the actual features are located in the TerraMat’s center, unlike the Topo mat.</p><p> While the TerraMat may have more features for you, it also shows more dirt, which we found was a large turnoff, especially since you’re encouraged to use these mats sans shoes. We really didn’t like putting our feet onto a clearly dirty mat. The Ergodriven mat hides dirt and slides more easily across the floor than the TerraMat. If you prefer a mat that hides the dirt, but still comes with the main stretching features, we recommend the Ergodriven. However, if you want all the bells and whistles to a standing desk mat, we think the TerraMat would be the better choice.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/cubefit-terramat-review-4775307" >CubeFit TerraMat Standing Desk Mat Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p><strong>Pricey, but solid for the features.</strong></p><p> For a standing desk mat with some exercise features, the Ergodriven Topo is a fairly decent choice. While we think there are other, better mats out there, but the Topo does hide dirt better, and the deep rear wedges stretch the hamstrings more than most other models on the market. If you want a solid stretch, then the Ergodriven Topo is the best choice for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141683/17092" target="_top" id="2141683">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141683" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141683/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Topo Standing Desk Mat</li><li>Product Brand  Ergodriven</li><li>MPN  000101FBA_9103</li><li>Price  $99.00</li><li>Product Dimensions  26.2 x 29 x 2.7 in.</li><li>Warranty  Seven Years</li><li>Connectivity Options  None</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-syma-x8c-mastering-advanced-maneuvers/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Syma X8C Mastering Advanced Maneuvers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-cutting-edge-from-srt-to-subtitle-system-for-2024/"><u>[New] Cutting Edge From SRT to Subtitle System for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/updated-streamlined-video-submission-mmc-to-vimeo-journey-explained-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Streamlined Video Submission MMC to Vimeo Journey Explained for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-compelling-footage-on-your-gopro/"><u>2024 Approved Crafting Compelling Footage on Your GoPro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-http.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-stunning-visuals-how-to-master-use-of-luts-in-photoshop-suite/"><u>2024 Approved Crafting Stunning Visuals How to Master Use of LUTs in Photoshop Suite</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-photos-from-razr-40-by-fonelab-android-recover-photos/"><u>How to recover deleted photos from Razr 40.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-designing-unique-instagram-post-cover-texts/"><u>In 2024, Designing Unique Instagram Post Cover Texts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-top-6-alternatives-to-twitch-for-your-streaming-needs/"><u>New 2024 Approved The Top 6 Alternatives to Twitch for Your Streaming Needs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/new-searching-for-free-sports-streaming-sites-look-no-further/"><u>New Searching for Free Sports Streaming Sites?

Close any unnecessary tabs or applications that may be consuming bandwidth. Consider using an ad blocker as well to cut interruptions. Additionally, connect your device via Ethernet for a more stable connection.</p><ul><li><strong>Understanding copyright laws and alternatives</strong></li></ul><p>While <strong>free football streaming websites</strong> offer convenience, it’s important to be aware of copyright laws. Engaging in illegal streaming may result in legal consequences. Instead, consider legal alternatives such as subscribing to legitimate streaming services. You can also watch matches through official broadcasters’ websites. They provide you with access to high-quality, authorized content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043593/7443" target="_top" id="2043593">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043593" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043593/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Boost-Your-Football-Audience-With-AI-Tools-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Boost-Your-Football-Audience-With-AI-Tools-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg"                      alt="live stream shopping"                ></p><p>One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.</p><p>As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:</p><h2 id="Part-2-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-1-Samsung-Live-Stream-1"><a href="#Part-2-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-1-Samsung-Live-Stream-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream"></a>Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream</h2><p>With the help <a class="link"   href="https://www.smartzer.com/shoppable-livestream-video" >of Smartzer’s Interactive Video Platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Samsung Panama delivered highly successful live video shopping for its customers.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Rotate-Your-iPhone-Screen-Back-to-Landscape-Easy-Solutions"><a href="#Rotate-Your-iPhone-Screen-Back-to-Landscape-Easy-Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Rotate Your iPhone Screen Back to Landscape - Easy Solutions"></a>Rotate Your iPhone Screen Back to Landscape - Easy Solutions</h2><p> Most of us have been frustrated by how our phones handle auto-rotation at some point. Occasionally, your iPhone might not recognize that you’ve rotated it, leaving you with a less-than-optimal viewing experience.</p><p> If you’re turning your iPhone and it’s not going into landscape mode, there are several possible issues that we will go over. You might also want to know whether it’s possible to force your iPhone into landscape mode, as you can do this with some iPhones but not others. So, let’s get started.</p><h2 id="Troubleshooting-iPhone-Landscape-Mode-Problems"><a href="#Troubleshooting-iPhone-Landscape-Mode-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Troubleshooting iPhone Landscape Mode Problems"></a>Troubleshooting iPhone Landscape Mode Problems</h2><p> Remember, although all the methods below will let you change the screen orientation on an iPhone, your phone should theoretically adjust itself whenever you physically rotate it. If it doesn’t, here are a few troubleshooting tips to try:</p><h3 id="1-Check-the-Portrait-Orientation-Lock"><a href="#1-Check-the-Portrait-Orientation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="1. Check the Portrait Orientation Lock"></a>1. Check the Portrait Orientation Lock</h3><p> Are you sure that you haven’t accidentally enabled the Portrait Orientation Lock? You’ll find this toggle in the Control Center, which many iPhone users accidentally enable but realize much later when landscape mode isn’t working.</p><p> On an iPhone with a Home button, swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access it. On an iPhone without a Home button, swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen instead.</p><p> Here, tap on the Portrait Orientation Lock toggle (which looks like a lock with a circular arrow) to turn it on or off. The lock will remain in place until you disable it again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iphone-portrait-lock.jpg"                      alt="iphone portrait lock"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997662/19272" target="_top" id="1997662">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997662" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997662/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896510/19272" target="_top" id="1896510">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896510" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896510/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Toggle-Display-Zoom"><a href="#2-Toggle-Display-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="2.

If you have one of these models and it’s not rotating, the Display Zoom feature might be to blame. To disable Display Zoom, follow the steps below:</p><ol><li>Open the<strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li>Go to<strong>Display and Brightness</strong> .</li><li>Scroll down to<strong>Display Zoom</strong> .</li><li>Go to<strong>View &gt; Default</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Settings-Screenshot-1.jpg"                      alt="Settings Screenshot iPhone"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/iPhone-Display-Settings-Screenshot.jpg"                      alt="iPhone Display Settings Screenshot"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Display-Zoom-Screenshot.jpg"                      alt="Display Zoom Screenshot"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886015/19272" target="_top" id="1886015">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886015" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886015/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Close</p><h2 id="Force-Landscape-Mode-Using-AssistiveTouch"><a href="#Force-Landscape-Mode-Using-AssistiveTouch" class="headerlink" title="Force Landscape Mode Using AssistiveTouch"></a>Force Landscape Mode Using AssistiveTouch</h2><p> You can use AssistiveTouch, an iOS feature that comes in handy <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/iphone-home-button-working-fix/" >when your iPhone’s Home button isn’t working <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , to force rotate your iPhone’s screen into landscape mode, even if you’re using the device in portrait mode. This is the only built-in way to force-rotate your iPhone screen.</p><p> To use AssistiveTouch, you first need to activate it in your iPhone’s Settings:</p><ol><li>Open the<strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li>Go to<strong>Accessibility &gt; Touch &gt; AssistiveTouch</strong> .</li><li>Make sure the toggle at the top of the screen is in the<strong>On</strong> position.</li><li>Tap one of the three options (<strong>Single Tap</strong> ,<strong>Double Tap</strong> , or<strong>Long Press</strong>) and set it to<strong>Open Menu</strong> .</li><li>Return to your iPhone’s Home Screen.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Settings-Screenshot.jpg"                      alt="Settings Screenshot"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Accessibility-Settings-Screenshot.jpg"                      alt="Accessibility Settings Screenshot"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868590/19272" target="_top" id="1868590">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868590" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868590/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AssistiveTouch-Settings-Screenshot.jpg"                      alt="AssistiveTouch Settings Screenshot"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AssistiveTouch-Screenshot.jpg"                      alt="AssistiveTouch Screenshot"                ></p><p>Close</p><p> You should now see a new floating Home button on the screen. Perform whichever action you set to<strong>Open Menu</strong> in the above steps, then go to<strong>Device &gt; Rotate Screen</strong> . You can force-rotate left, right, or upside down.</p><p> If you’re concerned about the new onscreen icon being distracting, don’t worry. It will fade when not in use, and you can tap and drag it to move it around your screen. In case you’re new to AssistiveTouch, you may want to learn <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/create-virtual-iphone-home-button-with-assistivetouch/" >how to use the virtual iPhone Home button <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Unfortunately, if you force iOS into landscape mode and then move your phone, the landscape setting will be overridden. So, you’ll have to use this option each time it resets.</p><p> The force rotate feature will not work on apps that do not support landscape view. Only the iPhone 6 Plus, 6S Plus, 7 Plus, and 8 Plus can rotate the iOS Home Screen. Therefore, there’s no possibility of a landscape Home Screen on iPhone X or later, likely due to the Face ID camera position.</p><h2 id="Use-a-Video-Rotation-App"><a href="#Use-a-Video-Rotation-App" class="headerlink" title="Use a Video Rotation App"></a>Use a Video Rotation App</h2><p> One of the main reasons people want to rotate the screen on their iPhones is to watch videos in the correct format. Of course, videos are naturally better in landscape mode, but the nature of smartphones means many people record their videos in portrait instead.</p><p> It’s easy to rotate videos from the<strong>Edit</strong> option in the<strong>Photos</strong> app on your iPhone. But not everyone keeps their videos in this app. Thankfully, some third-party apps on the App Store allow you to rotate your iPhone videos from portrait to landscape and vice-versa. One of the best video rotation apps on iOS is Video Rotate + Flip. It’s free to use with ads, which you can remove with a one-time fee of .99 cents.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Video-Rotate-Screenshot.png"                      alt="Screenshot of the Video Rotate + Flip app on the App Store."                ></p><p> Once you’ve converted your video from portrait to landscape in the app, it will export a copy to your iPhone’s Camera Roll. You can force-rotate videos of any length, and the app does not leave watermarks. It also works with videos in your Files app or those you download from Google Drive.</p><p> Lastly, because the videos get rotated at the frame level, the output is compatible with all video players on your Mac or Windows PC. Since these videos are saved to your Photos app, you can access them from iCloud.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/app/video-rotate-flip-video-easy/id1071677375?platform=iphone" >Video Rotate + Flip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (Free, premium version available)</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135399/19272" target="_top" id="2135399">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135399" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135399/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-Your-iPhone’s-Accelerometer-Broken"><a href="#Is-Your-iPhone’s-Accelerometer-Broken" class="headerlink" title="Is Your iPhone’s Accelerometer Broken?"></a>Is Your iPhone’s Accelerometer Broken?</h2><p> If you’ve checked all the solutions above but still can’t rotate your iPhone into landscape mode, it’s possible your iPhone has a broken accelerometer. The accelerometer is what tells your device that it’s been rotated and then rotates the screen to match.</p><p> The best way to check if your accelerometer is broken is to open an app that rotates like Notes and rotate it. If that doesn’t switch to landscape mode as it should, and Rotation Lock is off, then you might have an accelerometer issue.</p><p> It’s a possibility if you’ve eliminated every other probable cause. If you suspect this, you can <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/apple-store-appointment-genius-bar/" >make an Apple Store appointment at a Genius Bar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get it handled by experts.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> When you’re shopping for tablets, considering an iPad is almost inevitable. Launched in November of 2018, Apple’s new iPad Pro (11-inch) promised the world a number of bold changes to the original design, with sharper screens, better multitasking options, and a suite of new features that addressed past complaints. On the flip side, the Pro also commands a lofty price tag which raises the question, is this the iPad that can replace your laptop? We take a deep look at all aspects of its design, software, and performance to see if it lives up to those high expectations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/jYGLTeSXEAGonvbdFrussmvvPDU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_2-74153fdc1da44cbba893312f82da0547.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge"><a href="#Design-and-Features-Cutting-edge" class="headerlink" title="Design and Features: Cutting edge"></a><strong>Design and Features: Cutting edge</strong></h2><p> The iPad Pro is easy to pick up with one hand and barely makes a dent in your backpack storage. It feels like a notepad, and you can use it as such. For what is inside this piece of kit, that is a marvel This device even fits snug into the accessory slot of a laptop sleeve if you’re planning to double up. It is dainty, but what makes it so wonderful is that there are no compromises to make up for this, design-wise.</p><p> Apple’s latest revision does away with buttons and fingerprint sensors altogether to create an edge-to-edge screen with a smaller bezel. To still ensure a sense of security it ships with Face ID, popularised by the iPhone X. This means that after registering your face you can simply open up your iPad, and it will unlock almost instantly if you’re in view of the device’s front-facing camera, regardless of orientation. By removing most (but not all) of the bezel and sanding down the edges, the new iPad Pro has a far more stylish design than its predecessors.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most striking decisions Apple has made here is the inclusion of a USB-C port, which replaces the Lightning port at the bottom of the device. This opens up a world of possibilities for most creative types, from easily connecting the iPad to a monitor, or even uploading photos you want to edit directly from your DSLR camera.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/TpucPEgB2OHgSplLwk2Q6sbI6Yo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_5-a6f20cf2b7b84caf8a6290fcb5e9fb5f.jpg"                      alt="Ipad Pro 11-Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Accessories-Useful-for-productivity"><a href="#Accessories-Useful-for-productivity" class="headerlink" title="Accessories: Useful for productivity"></a><strong>Accessories: Useful for productivity</strong></h2><p> The two main attachments everyone should consider when purchasing an iPad Pro are the Apple Pencil and the Smart Keyboard Folio. The Apple Pencil is a powerful tool for artists and note takers, and the revised model includes a double-tap feature so you can quickly switch between brush styles and utilize functions usually locked off to the more PC-focused professional drawing tablets. Previous Apple Pencil users will be glad to know that it charges with a magnetic pad on the side of the device, and not awkwardly through the port at the bottom like previous models.</p><p> Yet, it does also drop the headphone jack, meaning you’re going to want a pair of wireless headphones or Airpods if you’re looking to edit video or listen to music on it in public. This would be ok if there was a USB-C to Lightning adaptor in the box, but Apple decided not to, which feels stingy, considering the price tag.</p><p> The Smart Keyboard Folio turns the iPad Pro into a writing machine and is an incredibly slick attachment with barely any heft to it. Simply snap your iPad in and it will let you type straight away. The fact it doubles up as a folio means you can give your device some much-needed protection without sacrificing productivity. Multiple magnets in the case ensure that your iPad can be wrapped up with care and stored safely when you’re on the move.</p><p> We wouldn’t call the iPad Pro child-friendly unless you wrap it in a rugged case and apply a decent screen protector, and even then it’s a stretch. Due to all of the productivity features, we believe the best use case for the tablet is in the hands of professionals rather than families. It’s for those who are looking for a premium tablet experience.</p><p> Top 3 Tablets On the Market</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fast-and-easy" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fast and easy"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fast and easy</strong></h2><p> Setting up the 11-inch iPad Pro is quick and painless, and strikingly similar to many of Apple’s other products. Once unboxed, we took the iPad out of its case and held down on the power button which led to the setup screen.</p><p> Following this, we used our iPhone to scan the visual code on the screen which quickly linked the devices and ensured a smooth setup. If you don’t own any other Apple products, you are led through a short set of screens where you pick your time zone, sign into your Apple ID, and connect to your WiFi. As part of the setup process, you also have to orient your head around the camera to ensure Face ID can set you up properly for the multiple viewing angles. Once everything has updated, you simply swipe up and are let loose into the Apple home screen from where you can start downloading and installing your apps.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/GV44W9kKlQd3SXT_XaWI-tjo6Cw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_6-2bcb5b2009154c92931411045a9b6ddc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100529/7443" target="_top" id="2100529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100529/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion"><a href="#Display-Rich-colors-and-smooth-motion" class="headerlink" title="Display: Rich colors and smooth motion"></a><strong>Display: Rich colors and smooth motion</strong></h2><p> Apple is well known for its gorgeous screens, and the iPad Pro absolutely delivers. The display is what Apple is calling ‘Liquid Retina’, an upgraded version of the technology that drives the screen on the iPhone XR. Wonderfully rich color reproduction, crisp text can be found across all of Apple’s proprietary apps and third-party optimized software. Reading articles and watching video content on streaming services is wonderful, and it even fares well amidst glare from sunlight. It’s still an LCD screen though, so OLED tablets will still have better-looking blacks and richer, more saturated colors. Fortunately for Apple, there aren’t many of those in the market.</p><p> There’s also some nifty usability features that come packed with the iPad Pro. True Tone is a feature that helps match the display to the color temperature of your surroundings, which makes the screen easier on your eyes. The 120Hz Pro Motion technology alters the refresh rate of the screen depending on your usage, which results in extremely fluid motion, from scrolling, to playing games, or watching video. It’s difficult to find a poor viewing angle, though you still can’t watch 4K video on YouTube, which is a crying shame given the power of the screen, but more of a problem between Apple and Google rather than a knock to the device itself.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1883998/19272" target="_top" id="1883998">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1883998" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1883998/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Powerhouse-processor"><a href="#Performance-Powerhouse-processor" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Powerhouse processor"></a><strong>Performance: Powerhouse processor</strong></h2><p> As touted by Apple during its launch presentation, the iPad Pro is said to be as powerful as an Xbox One S. This is true from a pure graphics perspective, but you have to consider that the iPad doesn’t have the same games or support, so while it is as powerful, it’s unlikely to replace your console anytime soon.</p><p> What it does have though is an unparalleled chip in the A12X Bionic, an utterly astounding eight-core processor that never breaks a sweat. In testing, we played PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and Bully: Scholarship Edition which the iPad breezed through. It also functions perfectly with several intensive apps open. We tried switching between the games in-play to more productivity-focused tasks like video editing or sketching and it still never faltered.</p><p> The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market.</p><p> Our Geekbench 4 benchmarks put the iPad Pro’s Multi-Core CPU performance at 18090, almost double that of the previous generation model utilizing the A10X Fusion chip, which sat at 9301. Single core there was another significant jump, with 5019 to the previous iPad’s 3906.</p><p> In our GFX Metal tests, the iPad really ran away from its competitors too. It scored 3407 frames in the Car Chase benchmark, almost double that of the Nvidia Shield, and nearly triple that of the previous iPad, running at an incredible 57 FPS (frames per second) compared to the previous iPads 23 FPS. It’s a massive, almost overkill leap considering the lack of AAA experiences available for the device, but it’s nice to have all that power in your hands.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/KXfYew06x6vujxu5asiFMPptK_k=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_1-a6ce9e62649048d7a20596066576c2c5.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135362/19272" target="_top" id="2135362">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135362" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135362/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet"><a href="#Productivity-Not-a-laptop-replacement-just-yet" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet"></a><strong>Productivity: Not a laptop replacement just yet</strong></h2><p> The 2018 iPad Pro is an absolute force of nature as far as productivity is concerned. With the brilliant viewing angles, and options to attach both a nimble Apple Pencil and a Smart Keyboard to the device with relative ease, this tablet will suit the needs of many modern creatives and workers looking for an all-in-one device.</p><p> Will it replace your laptop though? This is a major point of contention for people looking to take the plunge. Over our two week testing period we ended up using the iPad Pro for nearly every aspect of our workflow as a freelance writer, but we still don’t think it’s quite there yet.</p><p> The main feature that is an essential asset to your productivity is the Split View, that lets you bring up two apps from the dock that share equal (or 75&#x2F;25) of the real estate of your screen. This means, for example, you could boot up Notability and Google Docs to transfer your notes into an article, or Procreate and Safari if you want to use a reference image whilst you draw. As you can imagine, the apps become intertwined thanks to the multitouch gestures, where you can drag words or images between the two and make your workflow far more efficient than it would be if you were using a standard laptop. A lot of apps are well integrated for iOS and often better than their PC counterparts, but it is still certainly a mixed bag, especially for Adobe power users, who still have to suffer watered down applications, though more fully-functioned apps are on the way.</p><p> It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><p> Outside of that, you can’t connect some external drives, Thunderbolt devices or use a mouse. Split View is also certainly a compromise to professionals used to using more than three programs at once.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886019/19272" target="_top" id="1886019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886019/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Audio-Thunderous-sound"><a href="#Audio-Thunderous-sound" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Thunderous sound"></a><strong>Audio: Thunderous sound</strong></h2><p> One of the major upgrades to the Pro is the stereo effect audio playback with four powerful speakers, two on either side of the device. The iPad Pro has truly stunning audio, and if you crank it up it could easily act as a party speaker. There is absolutely no need for anything external when watching video content. Amazingly, the fidelity of the audio never seems to suffer, even at full volume. Apple ditching the headphone jack poses an interesting problem in that you’re going to need a pair of Bluetooth headphones or buy an adapter to receive audio on the go.</p><h2 id="Network-Reasonable-connectivity"><a href="#Network-Reasonable-connectivity" class="headerlink" title="Network: Reasonable connectivity"></a><strong>Network: Reasonable connectivity</strong></h2><p> In terms of signal strength, we struggled to get the WiFi to break by walking outside and away from our router. In the garden and the garage ( a usual drop-out spot for other devices) it held true in very reasonable fashion.</p><p> We received 72Mbps download speed and 6Mbps upload on our 100Mbps plan, a very respectable result. Downloading apps was quick and painless, and thanks to the incredible processor, there was very limited buffering time when booting up YouTube videos, Twitch streams and streaming video content on Netflix.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/D-1-WC_wIDqzRZLb8mDOgpjal6c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_3-e425a67865fc461fb805e648294dadf8.jpg"                      alt="IPad- Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><h2 id="Camera-A-decent-backup"><a href="#Camera-A-decent-backup" class="headerlink" title="Camera: A decent backup"></a><strong>Camera: A decent backup</strong></h2><p> One of the only design compromises is the small camera bump on the back of the tablet that makes it wobble a negligible amount whilst flat outside of a case. It’s still unwieldy to use, and whilst it’s a wonder why a tablet like this even needs a camera at all, Apple has actually given the tablet a camera worthy of the price tag.</p><p> The rear camera is 12 MP and very similar to the technology seen in the iPhone XS. The 7 MP front-facing camera features the same ‘Portrait Mode’ technology found in the latest lineup of phones, meaning you can alter the depth-of-field on selfies which is a nice touch. FaceTime functions confidently without much blur, and you can record 4K 60fps video with absolutely faultless playback.</p><p> The Pro is great for demoing Augmented Reality (AR) content, but after a quick search of the App Store and some googling, you’ll soon realize there are very few compelling AR experiences on the market, so this is more of a work in progress.</p><p> Take a peek at some of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-iphone-camera-apps-4176231" >best camera apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you can download.</p><h2 id="Battery-All-day-usage"><a href="#Battery-All-day-usage" class="headerlink" title="Battery: All-day usage"></a><strong>Battery: All-day usage</strong></h2><p> This is an all-day device, and should last you roughly around 10 hours of regular use, as per our testing. We spent almost a full working day pushing it using Split View to draft articles, with some Procreate drawing and Netflix streaming in between, and the iPad Pro clocked out at around 9 hours. However, we found some apps like Google Docs drain the battery more than most, so it varies depending on your workflow. Much like the Apple Watch, if you’re not a power user this tablet could last you a number of days before needing a fresh charge.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Q4zUu4bRCg_V0xhMi5Yh7Ns7znc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4036560-2_4-bef539783bbd48ae98e1becea11ce4dc.jpg"                      alt="IPad Pro 11 Inch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135408/19272" target="_top" id="2135408">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135408" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135408/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Jordan Provost</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137207/26400" target="_top" id="2137207">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137207" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137207/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-The-best-yet"><a href="#Software-The-best-yet" class="headerlink" title="Software: The best yet"></a><strong>Software: The best yet</strong></h2><p> This is interesting because iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement. You can’t just unzip files. And moving photos or documents between programs, even cloud-storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox, is a nightmare. In most cases, it’s actually doable if you find the right app, but it’s always far too much busy work when its a very simple five-second solution on any laptop. This wasted time adds up, and iOS 12 starts to get in the way of the iPad Pro’s potential.</p><p> Due to the particular size of the screen, developers have to update all of their apps to fit properly on the iPad Pro, but even months after its release there are many apps that throw up horrible black bars between the software and the device bezel. Snapchat and Instagram are mostly unusable too, unless you’re willing to compromise with a downscaled, emulated version of the iPhone app.</p><p> iOS 12 is by far and away the best version of the operating system yet, but there are still some blatant compromises that eat away at the possibility of the iPad Pro being a laptop replacement.</p><h2 id="Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it"><a href="#Price-Well-worth-the-money-if-you-can-justify-it" class="headerlink" title="Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it"></a><strong>Price: Well worth the money if you can justify it</strong></h2><p> As far as tablets go, one of the main reasons many people are put off by the iPad Pro is the existence of far cheaper options. Our review model (11-inch, 64GB) retails for $799, and you may well be inclined to upgrade both the size and the capacity to suit your needs. This doesn’t factor in some of the more essential accessories with jaw-dropping prices like the Apple Pencil, Smart Keyboard, and the Bluetooth headphones necessary to navigate the lack of a headphone jack. That can lead to a very expensive purchase, and with Apple products, it can be hard to tell whether they are worth it case by case.</p><p> Luckily, the 11-inch iPad Pro is such a revolutionary upgrade on most tablets that you do truly get what you pay for here. The A12X Bionic puts it leagues ahead of the competition, making it the most powerful productivity machine for professional creatives on the market. There is nothing really competing at this price range beyond.</p><h2 id="Competition-Hard-to-beat"><a href="#Competition-Hard-to-beat" class="headerlink" title="Competition: Hard to beat"></a><strong>Competition: Hard to beat</strong></h2><p> Nothing can really compete as far as power is concerned when it comes to the iPad Pro, so you’re mostly looking at compromises with certain benefits. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S4 doesn’t suffer from the same locked off functionality of iOS 12 with its Android architecture and has a better AMOLED screen. It also comes packaged with a stylus, which mitigates some of the cost of the Apple Pencil if you find a stylus necessary. This device retails at $649.99, making it more affordable than the iPad. The Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is another option, and may be a better fit for replacing your laptop than the iPad, with its fully functional Windows 10 OS, but it’s still costly at $799. You could always roll back to the early 2018 9.7-inch iPad if you want to save some money. This will set you back $329 and cover most of your bases, but you’ll miss out on updates like Face ID, the sleek new design, and accessories.</p><p> Interested in reading more reviews?

Unfortunately, whilst the power is there, it is held back by its own operating system, forcing you into busywork or compromising missteps. It cannot replace your laptop just yet, but it may well make it redundant based on your use case.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/863035/11832" target="_top" id="863035">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-863035" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/863035/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed"><a href="#Similar-Products-We’ve-Reviewed" class="headerlink" title="Similar Products We’ve Reviewed"></a>Similar Products We’ve Reviewed</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-10-2-inch-7th-generation-review-4772313" >Apple iPad 10.2-inch (7th Generation) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-surface-go-review-4690827" >Microsoft Surface Go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/apple-ipad-mini-2019-review-4688991" >Apple iPad Mini (2019) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  iPad Pro 11-Inch (2018)</li><li>Product Brand  Apple</li><li>Price  $799.99</li><li>Release Date  November 2018</li><li>Weight  1.03 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  7.02 x 9.74 x 0.23 in.</li><li>Color  Space Gray</li><li>Warranty  Applecare</li><li>RAM  4 GB</li><li>Camera  12 MP</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/2024s-leading-pick-of-extra-hard-disk-blu-ray-readers-and-writers/"><u>2024'S Leading Pick of Extra Hard Disk Blu-Ray Readers & Writers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/acemagic-unveils-star-wars-inspired-x-wing-miniature-gaming-computer-for-may-the-fourth-day/"><u>AceMagic Unveils Star Wars-Inspired X-Wing Miniature Gaming Computer for May the Fourth Day</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/comprehensive-analysis-the-power-of-the-samsung-galaxy-note20-ultra-5g/"><u>Comprehensive Analysis: The Power of the Samsung Galaxy Note20 Ultra 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/elevate-fathers-day-gifting-with-an-immersive-ibuypower-computer-experience/"><u>Elevate Father’s Day Gifting with an Immersive iBUYPOWER Computer Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/exclusive-offer-chip-in-an-extra-250-for-your-ultimate-rtx-cuarto-pc/"><u>Exclusive Offer: Chip In An Extra $250 for Your Ultimate RTX Cuarto PC!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-gps-on-itel-p40-for-mobile-legends-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How To Fake GPS On Itel P40 For Mobile Legends?

Among those ways, livestream shopping is a cool trend with a fun shopping experience. It became trendy in China in 2020 when the pandemic led to a physical market shutdown. This unfortunate incident led to the growth of the digital industry worldwide, becoming a blessing in disguise.</p><p><strong>China’s live shopping</strong> keeps growing because of its diversity and advanced AI technology. Learn about how this live shopping experience has developed across the border through this review article.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/china-live-shopping-industry-dynamics-1.jpg"                      alt="china live shopping developing dynamics"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Basic-Concept-of-Livestream-Shopping-What-It-Is"><a href="#Part-1-The-Basic-Concept-of-Livestream-Shopping-What-It-Is" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

The Basic Concept of Livestream Shopping: What It Is?</h2><p>Livestream shopping is a practice that involves product promotion through a live video. This innovative concept creates an engaging environment for shopping through live video entertainment. Unlike traditional e-commerce, livestream shopping encourages active audience participation. As a result, viewers can get real-time product demonstrations and responses from the hosts.</p><p>Now that you know the concept of <strong>livestream shopping in China</strong>, let’s head to its requirements. You don’t need any physical platform as it operates completely online. Navigate through this section to learn about the requirements for successful livestream shopping:</p><h3 id="1-Video-Equipment"><a href="#1-Video-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="1.

Why is MLB Restricted in Different Regions for Users?</h2><p>TV viewership of MLB games is declining due to geographical restrictions. Local TV channels purchase the broadcasting rights and impose a blackout policy. This policy restricts the game and makes it unavailable in other regions. In this way, blackouts protect the rights of local broadcasters and live-streaming services.</p><p>Moreover, the blackout policy varies according to different factors. They include league agreements, regional broadcasting rights, and teams’ home territories. For instance, at least one team is blackout out in every region of the United States. Even some surrounding regions of specific teams also have blackout restrictions. Lowa is the worst blackout out in the USA state, with six teams blacked out.</p><p>Due to having limitations, fans are forced to find <strong>MLB streaming sites</strong> to watch matches.

How To Use Free Football Streaming Websites?</h2><p>To maximize your experience with free football streaming websites, consider the following tips:</p><ul><li><strong>Using a VPN</strong></li></ul><p>If a streaming website is geo-restricted in your region, consider using a VPN. A VPN can change your IP address to access a website from a different location. It grants you access to content that may be otherwise unavailable in your area.</p><ul><li><strong>Optimizing the streaming experience</strong></li></ul><p>Ensure a smooth streaming experience by optimizing your internet connection. Close any unnecessary tabs or applications that may be consuming bandwidth. Consider using an ad blocker as well to cut interruptions. Additionally, connect your device via Ethernet for a more stable connection.</p><ul><li><strong>Understanding copyright laws and alternatives</strong></li></ul><p>While <strong>free football streaming websites</strong> offer convenience, it’s important to be aware of copyright laws. Engaging in illegal streaming may result in legal consequences. Instead, consider legal alternatives such as subscribing to legitimate streaming services. You can also watch matches through official broadcasters’ websites. They provide you with access to high-quality, authorized content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Boost-Your-Football-Audience-With-AI-Tools-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Boost-Your-Football-Audience-With-AI-Tools-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold.

They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.</p><h3 id="What-is-live-stream-shopping"><a href="#What-is-live-stream-shopping" class="headerlink" title="What is live stream shopping?"></a>What is live stream shopping?</h3><p>Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg"                      alt="live stream shopping"                ></p><p>One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.</p><p>As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:</p><h2 id="Part-2-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-1-Samsung-Live-Stream"><a href="#Part-2-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-1-Samsung-Live-Stream" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream"></a>Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream</h2><p>With the help <a class="link"   href="https://www.smartzer.com/shoppable-livestream-video" >of Smartzer’s Interactive Video Platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Samsung Panama delivered highly successful live video shopping for its customers.

Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the <strong>online live shopping</strong> success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Background-Information-of-Live-Stream-Shopping-1"><a href="#Part-1-Background-Information-of-Live-Stream-Shopping-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping"></a>Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping</h2><p>A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.</p><h3 id="What-is-live-stream-shopping-1"><a href="#What-is-live-stream-shopping-1" class="headerlink" title="What is live stream shopping?"></a>What is live stream shopping?</h3><p>Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg"                      alt="live stream shopping"                ></p><p>One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.</p><p>As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:</p><h2 id="Part-2-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-1-Samsung-Live-Stream-1"><a href="#Part-2-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-1-Samsung-Live-Stream-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream"></a>Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream</h2><p>With the help <a class="link"   href="https://www.smartzer.com/shoppable-livestream-video" >of Smartzer’s Interactive Video Platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Samsung Panama delivered highly successful live video shopping for its customers.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Boost-Sales-with-Live-Shopping-Learn-Winning-Strategies-From-Top-Brands"><a href="#Boost-Sales-with-Live-Shopping-Learn-Winning-Strategies-From-Top-Brands" class="headerlink" title="Boost Sales with Live Shopping: Learn Winning Strategies From Top Brands"></a>Boost Sales with Live Shopping: Learn Winning Strategies From Top Brands</h2><p><strong>Live shopping</strong> has quickly grown in popularity due to the see-no-want-now mentality. Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the <strong>online live shopping</strong> success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Background-Information-of-Live-Stream-Shopping"><a href="#Part-1-Background-Information-of-Live-Stream-Shopping" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping"></a>Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping</h2><p>A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.</p><h3 id="What-is-live-stream-shopping"><a href="#What-is-live-stream-shopping" class="headerlink" title="What is live stream shopping?"></a>What is live stream shopping?</h3><p>Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg"                      alt="live stream shopping"                ></p><p>One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand. Shoppers can tune in to a live show to learn more about the product and leave comments the same way they would in an Instagram or YouTube Live. On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.</p><p>As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:</p><h2 id="Part-2-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-1-Samsung-Live-Stream"><a href="#Part-2-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-1-Samsung-Live-Stream" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream"></a>Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream</h2><p>With the help <a class="link"   href="https://www.smartzer.com/shoppable-livestream-video" >of Smartzer’s Interactive Video Platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Samsung Panama delivered highly successful live video shopping for its customers. The shoppable livestream featured exclusive, event-based discount deals for the customers. During the livestream shopping experience, sales representatives from Samsung would demonstrate various products to hundreds of viewers. At the same time, customers would communicate with the host through a chatbot using their nicknames.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-2.jpg"                      alt="samsung live shop"                ></p><p><strong>Achievement:</strong> The Samsung livestream shopping created a personalized and bespoke shopping experience, replicating the benefits of in-person shopping. Product demonstrations by sales reps and exclusive deals captivated hundreds of viewers. In addition, the interactive chat that was fueled by personalized nicknames fostered an engaging and lovely atmosphere. This led to a significant boost in sales and customer satisfaction.</p><p><strong>Lessons drawn</strong>: Livestream shopping combined with interactive features and exclusive deals unlocks a powerful sales channel. With personalized engagement, brands can gain from fostering real-time connections with viewers. It also allows them to create an engaging and informative experience while fostering compelling value propositions.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-2-Giosg-One-on-One-Live-Shop"><a href="#Part-3-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-2-Giosg-One-on-One-Live-Shop" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 2: Giosg One-on-One Live Shop"></a>Part 3: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 2: Giosg One-on-One Live Shop</h2><p>In one of the game-changing strategies, <a class="link"   href="https://www.giosg.com/en/live-video-shopping" >giosg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> launched an online live shopping feature that allows sellers to have one-to-one voice and video calls with customers. With this feature, sellers can handhold their customers throughout the entire shopping process. The live online shopping feature works in the same way sales executives approach customers in traditional settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-3.jpg"                      alt="giosg live shop"                ></p><p><strong>Achievement:</strong> The live online shopping feature by giosg offers a unique and seamless shopping experience for other sellers and customers. It is like having a virtual shopping or sales assistant that takes the customer’s shopping experience to the next level. This live shopping feature revolutionizes online retail by bridging the gap between traditional sales tactics and e-commerce. Sellers could replicate personalized guidance and build trust through one-on-one video calls. As a result, they reported a surge in customer engagement and conversion rates.</p><p><strong>Lessons drawn:</strong> Implementing an online live shopping feature is an effective way of giving a more personalized and boutique experience to consumers. When done right, it can boost customer satisfaction in ways that live shopping videos would not achieve on a large scale. Technology is also seen as an enabler in this case. By integrating video calls into an e-commerce platform, the brand created a seamless and engaging experience for the shoppers, blurring the lines between online and offline shopping.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-3-Nordstrom-In-person-and-Live-Shopping-Blend"><a href="#Part-4-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-3-Nordstrom-In-person-and-Live-Shopping-Blend" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 3: Nordstrom In-person and Live Shopping Blend"></a>Part 4: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 3: Nordstrom In-person and Live Shopping Blend</h2><p>The American luxury department store chain Nordstrom launched a <a class="link"   href="https://nordstromrsvp.com/nlive" >live online shop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> intending to blend its digital and in-person capabilities.

Shoppers also have access to informative events by experts in fashion, beauty, and home.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-4.jpg"                      alt="Nordstrom live shop"                ></p><p><strong>Achievement:</strong> The live stream shop significantly impacted Nordstrom’s performance in the market.

Sellers and consumers in most parts of the world have embraced this trend, influencing how products are being sold. In this article, we are going to look at some of the <strong>online live shopping</strong> success case studies and the lessons we can learn from them.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Background-Information-of-Live-Stream-Shopping-1"><a href="#Part-1-Background-Information-of-Live-Stream-Shopping-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping"></a>Part 1: Background Information of Live Stream Shopping</h2><p>A few years ago, channels like QVC were popular for engaging viewers in live shopping. They would successfully link up entertainment, socializing, and shopping. This meant that customers had the opportunity to interact and shop with their favorite hosts. The same approach has now evolved to live shopping through streaming platforms.</p><h3 id="What-is-live-stream-shopping-1"><a href="#What-is-live-stream-shopping-1" class="headerlink" title="What is live stream shopping?"></a>What is live stream shopping?</h3><p>Live streaming brings the old-time practice of home shopping to modern times, but the concept remains the same. Sellers can now showcase their products in real time while customers can buy them seamlessly online. The highly engaging experience goes beyond simply clicking on items and filling up a shopping cart. It is also about offering product demonstrations and promotions that stay valid during the entire live stream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/live-shopping-success-secrets-unveiling-strategies-from-real-case-studies-1.jpg"                      alt="live stream shopping"                ></p><p>One of the factors that have made live stream shopping popular is how much users interact with a brand.

On the other hand, a seller can flash recommendations and reviews on the screen to guide the audience through their purchasing decision. You can think of live streaming shopping as the way we use social media platforms. Rather than liking a product, you now have the opportunity to directly buy it.</p><p>As live stream shopping continues to attract more people, several top brands have stood out for their success in this area. Let’s have a look at some of the brands that have made remarkable progress in this area and the lessons we can learn from them:</p><h2 id="Part-2-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-1-Samsung-Live-Stream-1"><a href="#Part-2-Success-Case-with-Live-Online-Shopping-1-Samsung-Live-Stream-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream"></a>Part 2: Success Case with Live Online Shopping 1: Samsung Live Stream</h2><p>With the help <a class="link"   href="https://www.smartzer.com/shoppable-livestream-video" >of Smartzer’s Interactive Video Platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Samsung Panama delivered highly successful live video shopping for its customers.

You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.</p><p>If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong></li></ul><p>When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.</p><ul><li><strong>GPU or graphic cards</strong></li></ul><p>Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU’s workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.</p><ol><li><strong>Microphone</strong></li></ol><p>Although you might get by using a gaming headset’s built-in microphone for a bit, it’s better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.</p><ol><li><strong>Webcam</strong></li></ol><p>If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice.

You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.</p><p>If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong></li></ul><p>When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.</p><ul><li><strong>GPU or graphic cards</strong></li></ul><p>Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU’s workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.</p><ol><li><strong>Microphone</strong></li></ol><p>Although you might get by using a gaming headset’s built-in microphone for a bit, it’s better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.</p><ol><li><strong>Webcam</strong></li></ol><p>If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.</p><p>You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-2.jpg"                      alt="Equipment for Twitch video streaming"                ></p><h3 id="Understanding-Twitch-Streaming-Rules-1"><a href="#Understanding-Twitch-Streaming-Rules-1" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Twitch Streaming Rules"></a>Understanding Twitch Streaming Rules</h3><p>Aside from preparing your streaming gear, you must also understand Twitch streaming rules to avoid any potential violations that could result in penalties or even suspension of your account.

How To Use Free Football Streaming Websites?</h2><p>To maximize your experience with free football streaming websites, consider the following tips:</p><ul><li><strong>Using a VPN</strong></li></ul><p>If a streaming website is geo-restricted in your region, consider using a VPN. A VPN can change your IP address to access a website from a different location. It grants you access to content that may be otherwise unavailable in your area.</p><ul><li><strong>Optimizing the streaming experience</strong></li></ul><p>Ensure a smooth streaming experience by optimizing your internet connection. Close any unnecessary tabs or applications that may be consuming bandwidth. Consider using an ad blocker as well to cut interruptions. Additionally, connect your device via Ethernet for a more stable connection.</p><ul><li><strong>Understanding copyright laws and alternatives</strong></li></ul><p>While <strong>free football streaming websites</strong> offer convenience, it’s important to be aware of copyright laws. Engaging in illegal streaming may result in legal consequences. Instead, consider legal alternatives such as subscribing to legitimate streaming services. You can also watch matches through official broadcasters’ websites. They provide you with access to high-quality, authorized content.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Boost-Your-Football-Audience-With-AI-Tools"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Boost-Your-Football-Audience-With-AI-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The two cheaper versions use a<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-picasso-ryzen-3000-apu,38241.html" >Ryzen 3 3200U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and a<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-5700u-lucienne-benchmark" >Ryzen 7 5700U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> based on AMD’s Zen 1 and Zen 2 architectures. For your reference, the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-zen-3-ryzen-5000-release-date-specifications-pricing-benchmarks-all-we-know" >Zen 3 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> architecture was released in late 2020, and we’re currently awaiting the release of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-shares-new-cpu-core-roadmap-3nm-zen-5-by-2024-4th-gen-infinity-architecture" >Zen 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here in 2024.</p><p> So, for the most part, the Ayaneo AM01 is still pretty much the same classic Macintosh-inspired mini-PC we covered before and has a very similar pricing scheme with the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-7-5800u-cezanne-zen-3-apu-geekbench-benchmark" >Ryzen 7 5800U <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it does with other units. As-is, the Zen 3 Ryzen 7 5800U model looks astonishingly identical to the Zen 2 Ryzen 7 5700U at a glance, with the same basic core&#x2F;thread spec, though, of course, the newer architecture has much better performance.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zkexFiVS4JdrAYoKakvYu5-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Current pricing matrix for the Zen 3-based Ryzen 7 5800U configuration of Ayaneo AM01."                ></p><p> Current pricing matrix for the Zen 3-based Ryzen 7 5800U configuration of Ayaneo AM01.  (Image credit: Ayaneo)</p><p> The Ayaneo blog post also confirms that the Ryzen 7 is slated to operate at up to 35 Watts on the AM01, an ample boost to the official maximum TDP of 25 Watts. This higher TDP enabled alongside the proper<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ram,4057.html" >RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> selection should help maximize the performance of the iGPU within.</p><p> Pricing-wise, the Ayaneo AM01 is best purchased during the Early Bird window, which is a solid $30 cheaper. Considering the specs and size of the device, the price point is pretty tolerable for what it is, though the best bang for your buck will be found in devices like the LCD<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/steam-deck-valve-gaming-handheld" >Steam Deck <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , used PCs, etc.</p><p> If you hope to get your hands on the Ayaneo AM01 PC as soon as possible, head to their Indiegogo page to buy the device through crowdfunding. And as always, while we acknowledge Ayaneo’s excellent track record in crowdfunded devices, you can’t know what to expect until people get their hands on it.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-basic-routines-for-recording-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Basic Routines for Recording on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-top-10-youtube-subtitle-tools/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Ultimate List Top 10 YouTube Subtitle Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/2024-approved-highly-recommended-auto-cameras-for-vehicle-tracking/"><u>2024 Approved Highly Recommended Auto Cameras for Vehicle Tracking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/diy-dvd-conversion-for-windows-11-a-straightforward-process-walkthrough/"><u>DIY DVD Conversion for Windows 11: A Straightforward Process Walkthrough</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/embarking-on-a-path-in-natural-language-processing-the-role-of-a-prompt-engineer/"><u>Embarking on a Path in Natural Language Processing: The Role of a Prompt Engineer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/how-the-garmin-forerunner-45-revolutionizes-your-running-experience/"><u>How the Garmin Forerunner 45 Revolutionizes Your Running Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-live-streaming.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-game-stuttering-a-comprehensive-guide-with-focused-examples-on-cyberpunk-2077/"><u>How to Fix Game Stuttering?

The AM01 mini PC is reminiscent of the Macintosh Classic and is available in multiple configurations. The AM01 is much smaller than the Macintosh Classic, but it’s packed with features and can be purchased with a memory configuration of between 8 and 32GB and primary SSD storage options of up to 1TB.</p><p> Ayaneo updated its AM01 mini PC<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/ayaneo-am01-macintosh-esque-mini-pc-design-gets-an-amd-zen-3-upgrade" >a few weeks ago <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the Ryzen 7 5800U variant. The AMD Ryzen 7 5800U is an older CPU — launched in 2021 — and is based on the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-zen-3-zen-4-epyc-rome-milan-genoa-architecture-microarchitecture,40561.html" >Zen 3 architecture <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> featuring on-chip Radeon Vega 8 graphics.

To access the settings window, hit the “Settings” option in the “Controls” panel.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/guide-to-stream-to-instagram-with-rtmp-2.jpg"                      alt="proceed to settings in obs"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Look for the “Video” tab in the “Settings” window that opens. After that, enter “1080x1920” in the “Base (Canvas) Resolution” bar. Similarly, add a “1080x1920” value in the “Output (Scaled) Resolution” bar to set a 9:16 aspect ratio for vertical display. Then, hit the “OK” button to apply these changes to your Instagram streams.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/guide-to-stream-to-instagram-with-rtmp-3.jpg"                      alt="set canvas resolution"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> After that, you need to add external sources to the scene.

But to do well on Twitch, you need to prepare properly so your viewers can enjoy watching your content.</p><p>To start streaming on Twitch, here’s what you’ll need:</p><h3 id="Twitch-Streaming-Software"><a href="#Twitch-Streaming-Software" class="headerlink" title="Twitch Streaming Software"></a>Twitch Streaming Software</h3><p>First, you need to download streaming software for your Twitch video streaming. OBS Studio is the popular one, but Twitch has released its Twitch Studio, which is more beginner-friendly.</p><ol><li><strong>OBS Studio</strong></li></ol><p>OBS Studio is a free streaming software that works on any device. You can use it to make your Twitch streams live more attractive by adding alerts, creating starting screens, and using different audio and video sources.</p><ol><li><strong>Twitch Studio</strong></li></ol><p>Twitch Studio is the official free streaming application developed to simplify the streaming process for new streamers on Twitch. It offers an intuitive interface and pre-made scenes designed to streamline the user experience.</p><h3 id="Streaming-equipment"><a href="#Streaming-equipment" class="headerlink" title="Streaming equipment"></a>Streaming equipment</h3><ol><li><strong>A device to stream from</strong></li></ol><p>To kickstart your Twitch streaming journey, the first step you need to take is selecting the device from which you’ll broadcast. You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.</p><p>If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong></li></ul><p>When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.</p><ul><li><strong>GPU or graphic cards</strong></li></ul><p>Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU’s workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.</p><ol><li><strong>Microphone</strong></li></ol><p>Although you might get by using a gaming headset’s built-in microphone for a bit, it’s better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.</p><ol><li><strong>Webcam</strong></li></ol><p>If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.</p><p>You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-2.jpg"                      alt="Equipment for Twitch video streaming"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141683/17092" target="_top" id="2141683">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141683" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141683/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Understanding-Twitch-Streaming-Rules"><a href="#Understanding-Twitch-Streaming-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Twitch Streaming Rules"></a>Understanding Twitch Streaming Rules</h3><p>Aside from preparing your streaming gear, you must also understand Twitch streaming rules to avoid any potential violations that could result in penalties or even suspension of your account.

But to do well on Twitch, you need to prepare properly so your viewers can enjoy watching your content.</p><p>To start streaming on Twitch, here’s what you’ll need:</p><h3 id="Twitch-Streaming-Software-1"><a href="#Twitch-Streaming-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="Twitch Streaming Software"></a>Twitch Streaming Software</h3><p>First, you need to download streaming software for your Twitch video streaming. OBS Studio is the popular one, but Twitch has released its Twitch Studio, which is more beginner-friendly.</p><ol><li><strong>OBS Studio</strong></li></ol><p>OBS Studio is a free streaming software that works on any device. You can use it to make your Twitch streams live more attractive by adding alerts, creating starting screens, and using different audio and video sources.</p><ol><li><strong>Twitch Studio</strong></li></ol><p>Twitch Studio is the official free streaming application developed to simplify the streaming process for new streamers on Twitch. It offers an intuitive interface and pre-made scenes designed to streamline the user experience.</p><h3 id="Streaming-equipment-1"><a href="#Streaming-equipment-1" class="headerlink" title="Streaming equipment"></a>Streaming equipment</h3><ol><li><strong>A device to stream from</strong></li></ol><p>To kickstart your Twitch streaming journey, the first step you need to take is selecting the device from which you’ll broadcast. You can use your desktop, mobile phone, or gaming console. Your choice will depend on your existing equipment and the nature of your intended content.</p><p>If you plan to make gaming content for your Twitch Live, we recommend using a PC with these specifications:</p><ul><li><strong>CPU</strong></li></ul><p>When streaming and gaming, it’s crucial to have a powerful CPU to minimize lagging. The number of cores in a CPU determines its processing power, ranging from dual to eight cores. Some good options to consider are the AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, Intel i9 – 12900K, or the more budget-friendly Intel Core i5-12400.</p><ul><li><strong>GPU or graphic cards</strong></li></ul><p>Nvidia RTX graphics cards come equipped with built-in hardware encoders, which can lighten the CPU’s workload when used with OBS Studio. Alternatively, you can consider the Radeon RX 570 and the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for quality GPU options.</p><ol><li><strong>Microphone</strong></li></ol><p>Although you might get by using a gaming headset’s built-in microphone for a bit, it’s better to invest in a standalone mic from the start. Some top microphone options for Twitch streaming include the Elgato Wave:3, HyperX QuadCast S, Audio-Technica AT2020, Razer Seiren Mini, and Blue Yeti X.</p><ol><li><strong>Webcam</strong></li></ol><p>If your Twitch stream content involves showcasing your reactions or facial expressions, investing in a camera is a wise choice. Webcams are convenient as they can easily connect to your computer or laptop.</p><p>You can consider some popular webcam choices like the Logitech HD Pro C920, Logitech StreamCam, Logitech BRIO, Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, and Razer Kiyo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/04/how-to-perform-a-successful-streaming-on-twitch-2.jpg"                      alt="Equipment for Twitch video streaming"                ></p><h3 id="Understanding-Twitch-Streaming-Rules-1"><a href="#Understanding-Twitch-Streaming-Rules-1" class="headerlink" title="Understanding Twitch Streaming Rules"></a>Understanding Twitch Streaming Rules</h3><p>Aside from preparing your streaming gear, you must also understand Twitch streaming rules to avoid any potential violations that could result in penalties or even suspension of your account.

But worry not, fellow explorer! This part will unveil the best <strong>web streaming services</strong> offering unique strengths and features. Get ready to unlock a world of curated content and personalized recommendations, from Hollywood blockbusters to cult classics, binge-worthy shows, and live sports.</p><h3 id="Free-Streaming-Services"><a href="#Free-Streaming-Services" class="headerlink" title="Free Streaming Services"></a>Free Streaming Services</h3><p>First off, here are the <strong>free streaming services</strong> available today. You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don’t worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.</p><h4 id="Tubi"><a href="#Tubi" class="headerlink" title="Tubi"></a>Tubi</h4><p>Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it’s a fair trade-off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-02.jpg"                      alt="tubi interface"                ></p><h4 id="Peacock"><a href="#Peacock" class="headerlink" title="Peacock"></a>Peacock</h4><p>Peacock offers a two-tiered approach. The free tier gives you everything, including movies, shows, popular NBCUniversal titles, news, and sports – but with ads. But the real treasure lies in the Premium subscription ($6 or $12&#x2F;month). Here, you’ll unlock a vast content library, such as live TV channels. So, consider upgrading for a more comprehensive selection and an ad-free experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-03.jpg"                      alt="peacock interface"                ></p><h4 id="Crackle"><a href="#Crackle" class="headerlink" title="Crackle"></a>Crackle</h4><p>If you’re a fan of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Crackle is your free portal to their content.

Remember, you’ll encounter ads along the way.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-04.jpg"                      alt="crackle interface"                ></p><h3 id="Premium-Streaming-Services"><a href="#Premium-Streaming-Services" class="headerlink" title="Premium Streaming Services"></a>Premium Streaming Services</h3><p>This list will present premium streaming services, meaning the rest of their libraries are not forever accessible with a free plan.

You can access them scot-free, with the caveat that you must go through advertisements. Don’t worry; these sites offer minimal advertisements, so you can enjoy your shows or streams without pesky ads appearing occasionally.</p><h4 id="Tubi-1"><a href="#Tubi-1" class="headerlink" title="Tubi"></a>Tubi</h4><p>Tubi is a haven for budget-conscious viewers, offering a massive library of free movies and TV shows. Dive into classic comedies, cult favorites, and hidden gems across various genres. While focusing on older content, some recent releases are sprinkled in. Be prepared for frequent ad breaks, but for the price (free!), it’s a fair trade-off.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/best-streaming-service-02.jpg"                      alt="tubi interface"                ></p><h4 id="Peacock-1"><a href="#Peacock-1" class="headerlink" title="Peacock"></a>Peacock</h4><p>Peacock offers a two-tiered approach.

Not to mention that all the fumbling doesn’t guarantee a fix for the microphone not working problem on your PC.</p><p> If this is also you, and your Realtek microphone is not working no matter what software programs you’re using: Skype, Zoom, and all sorts of multi-player games, don’t worry: you’re definitely not alone. This has been a long-term problem for Windows users since Windows 7. Here we have some fixes that’ll help to get this problem sorted. Read on and see what more you can do.</p><h2 id="Try-these-fixes-for-the-Realtek-microphone-not-working-problem"><a href="#Try-these-fixes-for-the-Realtek-microphone-not-working-problem" class="headerlink" title="Try these fixes for the Realtek microphone not working problem"></a>Try these fixes for the Realtek microphone not working problem</h2><p> You don’t have to try all the following fixes: simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick to fix the Realtek microphone not working problem for you.</p><ol><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Make sure your microphone is not muted <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Update Windows <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Update the sound card driver <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Use the sound card driver from your computer manufacturer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Repair corrupted or damaged system files <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Update BIOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Reset your computer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li><li><strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Final thought <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></li></ol><hr><h2 id="1-Make-sure-your-microphone-is-not-muted"><a href="#1-Make-sure-your-microphone-is-not-muted" class="headerlink" title="1. Make sure your microphone is not muted"></a>1. Make sure your microphone is not muted</h2><p> This may be hard to believe, but there are cases when the Realtek microphone is back to working again when people just switch the mute button off. This is especially true on laptops with physical switches or function keys to mute and unmute the microphone.</p><p> So the first thing you do when your Realtek microphone doesn’t work is to make sure that it’s not muted by any physical button or function key.</p><p> If you’re not sure if you have such a setting on your computer, you can always check your computer manual for more details.</p><p> When you’re sure that this is not the reason why your Realtek microphone is not working, please move further to the other fixes below.</p><hr><h2 id="2-Update-Windows"><a href="#2-Update-Windows" class="headerlink" title="2. Update Windows"></a>2. Update Windows</h2><p> If the Realtek microphone not working problem just happens all of a sudden, it’s likely related to outdated or faulty system files. This is because outdated or corrupted system files could cause compatibility issues with computer services such as audio ones. To make sure that you have the latest available updates installed:</p><ol><li>On your keyboard, hit the<strong>Windows</strong> key, then type<strong>check for update</strong> s, then click C<strong>heck for updates</strong> .</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-18.png"                                     ><br>2.

Update the sound card driver</h2><p> An outdated or incorrect sound card driver could also be the culprit to your Realtek microphone not working problem, so if the above two methods don’t help to restore your microphone, it’s likely that you have a corrupted or outdated audio driver. So you should update your drivers to see if it helps.</p><p> If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the sound card driver manually, you can do it automatically with <strong><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>  .

Use the sound card driver from your computer manufacturer"></a>4. Use the sound card driver from your computer manufacturer</h2><p> If the latest driver for the Realtek sound card doesn’t help to fix its microphone not working problem, it’s time to consider a different driver, and the one from your computer manufacturer is the go-to option.</p><p> The sound card driver from your computer manufacturer in most cases is older than the one provided by Driver Easy. This is because your computer manufacturer needs extra time to customize the driver files so they work better on their computers, while Driver Easy usually gets the latest driver from Realtek directly.</p><p> To find the correct sound card driver from your manufacturer, you first need to know your computer brand and model. You can follow the instructions here:<a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/"><strong>How to view the entire computer specs through System Information</strong></a> to check your system specs in the<strong>System Information</strong> tool.</p><p> Once you have your computer specs, you can then search keyword combinations like your computer manufacturer plus its model to find the correct driver download page:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-53.png"                                     ></p><p> For instance, my keyword combination should be<strong>Dell Vostro 3670 driver download</strong></p><p> Go only to the official website of your manufacturer, then find the driver for your Realtek sound card, and download and install the correct driver for your computer.</p><p> If the above steps are too much for you to follow, or if you don’t have the time or energy to find the correct driver for your computer, you can always talk to<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/" >Driver Easy support <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (which comes with<a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/"><strong>Driver Easy Pro</strong></a> ) and they’ll help you out.</p><hr><h2 id="5-Repair-corrupted-or-damaged-system-files"><a href="#5-Repair-corrupted-or-damaged-system-files" class="headerlink" title="5. Repair corrupted or damaged system files"></a>5. Repair corrupted or damaged system files</h2><p><strong>Repairing corrupted or damaged system files</strong> could also help fix issues like the Realtek microphone not working on PC. This is because the integrity of Windows system files is essential for proper operation and stability, while errors in critical system files can cause all sorts of problems that affect the overall system performance.</p><p> By repairing the core Windows system files, it may resolve conflicts, missing DLL issues, registry errors, and other problems that contribute to instability and incompatibility with system services and programs.

But you should always check your motherboard’s BIOS update release note to see if the microphone issue is mentioned.</p><p> If you’re up for a BIOS update, here’s a post on how you can do it manually:<a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/"><strong>How to Update BIOS on Windows 11</strong></a></p><p> DO NOT attempt a BIOS update if you’re not 100% confident in knowing what you’re doing, as a faulty BIOS update could harm or even brick your computer.</p><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975807/19272" target="_top" id="1975807">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975807" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975807/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="7-Reset-your-computer"><a href="#7-Reset-your-computer" class="headerlink" title="7.

Reset your computer</h2><p> If none of the above helps to restore your Realtek microphone, not even the BIOS update, you may need to consider a Windows reset: it wipes out all software incompatibilities and problems, it’s also the rule of thumb in telling a software problem from a hardware one: if the problem remains even after a system reset, then it’s definitely a hardware problem.</p><p> To reinstall or reset your computer, here’s a post for your reference: <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/"> <strong>Reinstall&#x2F;Reset Windows 10 [Step By Step]</strong> </a></p><p> If the Realtek microphone remains not working even after a reset, then the next thing you should do is seek help from a hardware technician to see if your hardware components (the motherboard or the Realtek sound card) are at fault.</p><hr><h2 id="8-Final-thought"><a href="#8-Final-thought" class="headerlink" title="8.

Final thought</h2><p> If you’ve tried fixes 1 to 6 mentioned here but are a bit reluctant to try a system reset, you can also an easier (and rather inexpensive) alternative: an external USB sound card.</p><p> It works as an external USB sound card, so you don’t need to use the built-in Realtek one for your microphone, which is an easy workaround if you don’t want a system reset, or get your motherboard or sound card repaired.</p><hr><p> Hope one of the methods above helps to fix the Realtek microphone not working problem for you, or at least point you in the right direction.
