Is it different from the ecommerce that most people know or just an enhanced version? Do you need any special tools to be successful in live stream ecommerce and how does it boost sales?</p>
<h3 id="01-What-is-Live-Commerce"><a href="#01-What-is-Live-Commerce" class="headerlink" title="01 What is Live Commerce?"></a>01 What is Live Commerce?</h3><p>Live commerce is the act of selling products online via immersive live shopping platforms. Brands and creators use live commerce in the form of live and shoppable videos to sell their products while shoppers can interact with brands in real-time. In simpler terms, live stream commerce is like a customer watching a livestream event but can shop.</p>

<h3 id="02-Benefits-of-Ecommerce-Live"><a href="#02-Benefits-of-Ecommerce-Live" class="headerlink" title="02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live"></a>02 Benefits of Ecommerce Live</h3><p>The e commerce live streaming trend started in China, and spread to other parts of the world quickly. This was back in 2016 when the Chinese retail giant Alibaba launched its live stream shopping event that became an instant success. Within the first 20 minutes, Alibaba had generated over $7.5 billion in transaction value.</p>
<p>Although the same approach had been used by QVC Home Shopping Network years before, the real integration of internet live shopping started with Alibaba. From this success, several notable benefits of e-commerce live streaming can be realized:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sales Acceleration</strong>: Live commerce generates sales quicker by exposing brands and products to thousands of viewers in minutes</li>
<li><strong>Promotes Better Engagement:</strong> With people being 2x more likely to share videos with their friends and families compared to static ads, live commerce generates higher engagement than other forms of content.</li>
<li><strong>Encourages Impulse Buying:</strong> People are more likely to buy a product when they are involved in an exclusive even for fear of missing out on the limited-time offers.</li>
<li><strong>Builds Brand Awareness:</strong> Live commerce allows consumers to see the face behind the brand or the influencers pushing the products, which makes them connect more with the brand.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are a new creator who is looking to make his mark as a successful streamer, then you should capitalize on what already seems to be working. Most creators make this fatal mistake when they try to invent something new, earlier in their streaming career.</p>
<p>However, you need to have a loyal audience in order to do so. People use YouTube to get information or some sort of entertainment. Whether you are a new creator or someone who already has a set audience, your main focus should be to discuss hot topics or play trending games to get views faster and efficiently.</p>
<p>To make it easier for you, let’s say that a new game rolls out. By discussing the game or playing the game on live stream, you are going to attract the right audience according to your YouTube channel and gain followers instead of being clueless.</p>

<p>Yes! It is possible to rank videos on the go as you go live. By doing YouTube research, you can leverage different keywords and rank for them as you go online. Most people make evergreen videos and put pre-recorded ones but compared to them, the live world is still small.</p>
<p>That is exactly your ticket to success. First, you need to understand the problems that your audience has. How can you solve them? What concerns do they have on a particular topic? Then, you need to go live, add the right description, choose tags, and talk about that particular topic to gain traction from people all over the world.</p>
<p>It seems like YouTube also pushes live content which means live creators have an edge compared to the ones that don’t go live.</p>

<p>With other tips on the list, you must be vary of how important your audience is especially when it comes to YouTube Live. The third secret and one of the most important <strong>YouTube streaming guidelines</strong> is building a community.</p>
<p>As you build your live community, you will have audience retention, meaning more people will come to you whenever you go live. You need to understand your audience deeply, what time you get the most viewers, and what interests your audience.</p>
<p>Once you do that, you also need to talk to them as they come live. Build deep connections with your viewers and you will see a huge increase in your subscribers and overall viewer count.</p>

                ></p>
<p>We live in an attention economy where hype is everything. If you look at some of the biggest live streamers, they create so much hype that people from all over the web would be curious enough to leave what they are doing and watch their streams. There are two main aspects to it.</p>
<p>First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.</p>
<p>But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Once you grow a little bit, you can collaborate with other streamers to join two audiences together. If you look closely, we have multiple streamers connecting with each other and having fun together. For example, Fouseytube sometimes connects with Sneako and both of them then go to N3on to make the biggest live stream in the history of social media.</p>
<p>When you collaborate with someone and entertain the audience in a way that they want to be, You need to not only build a community of people but also collaborate with other streamers which will open new aspects of your streaming journey.</p>

<p>Here’s what you can do to fix the issue. Firstly, you need to verify your account and wait for 24 hours for this issue to be fixed. It is because new channels need this type of verification to allow you to start streaming.</p>

<p>If you are a new creator who is looking to make his mark as a successful streamer, then you should capitalize on what already seems to be working. Most creators make this fatal mistake when they try to invent something new, earlier in their streaming career.</p>
<p>However, you need to have a loyal audience in order to do so. People use YouTube to get information or some sort of entertainment. Whether you are a new creator or someone who already has a set audience, your main focus should be to discuss hot topics or play trending games to get views faster and efficiently.</p>
<p>To make it easier for you, let’s say that a new game rolls out. By discussing the game or playing the game on live stream, you are going to attract the right audience according to your YouTube channel and gain followers instead of being clueless.</p>

Then, you need to go live, add the right description, choose tags, and talk about that particular topic to gain traction from people all over the world.</p>

<p>First, you need to create hype and secondly, you need to use social media the right way. Most successful streamers use Discord and then use their servers to recommend live streams before they even start it.</p>
<p>But what’s unique about this approach is that they have the time to create hype. You should tease some exciting content about the livestream and then people will be more interested in joining your podcasts.</p>
